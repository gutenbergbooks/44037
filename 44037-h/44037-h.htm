<h2><i>To the Boy who Reads the Book</i></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>YOU must not be surprised because the
adventures of Billy Topsail and a few of
his friends fill this book. If <em>all</em> the adventures
of these real boys were written the record
would fill many books. This is not hard to
explain. The British Colony of Newfoundland
lies to the north of the Gulf of St. Lawrence and
to the east of the Canadian Labrador. It is so
situated that the inhabitants may not escape adventures.
On the map, it looks bleak and far
away and inhospitable&mdash;a lonely island, outlying
in the stormy water of the Atlantic. Indeed, it
is all that. The interior is a vast wilderness&mdash;a
waste place. The folk are fishermen all. They
live on the coast, in little harbours, remote,
widely scattered, not connected by roads; communication
is only by way of the sea. They are
hospitable, fearless, tender, simple, willing for
toil; and, surely, little else can be said of a people.
Long, long ago, their forbears first strayed
up that forbidding shore in chase of the fish; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the succeeding generations, though such men as
we are, have there lived their lives, apart from
the world's comforts and delights as we know
them. The land is barren; sustenance is from
the sea, which is moody and cold and gray: thus
life in that far place has many perils and deprivations
and toilsome duties. The boys of the outports
are like English-speaking boys the world
over. They are merry or not, brave or not, kind
or not, as boys go; but it may be that they are
somewhat merrier and braver and kinder than
boys to whom self-reliance and physical courage
are less needful. At any rate, they have adventures,
every one of them; and that is not surprising&mdash;for
the conditions of life are such that
every Newfoundland lad intimately knows hardship
and peril at an age when the boys of the
cities still grasp a hand when they cross the
street.</div>

<div class='adtitle2'>THE ADVENTURES<br />
OF BILLY TOPSAIL</div>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<div class='summary'><i>In Which Young Billy Topsail of Ruddy Cove
Puts Out to His First Adventure with His Dog
in the Bow of the Punt</i></div>


<div class='drop-cap'>FROM the very beginning it was inevitable
that Billy Topsail should have adventures.
He was a fisherman's son, born at Ruddy
Cove, which is a fishing harbour on the bleak
northeast coast of Newfoundland; and there was
nothing else for it. All Newfoundland boys
have adventures; but not all Newfoundland
boys survive them. And there came, in the
course of the day's work and play, to Billy Topsail,
many adventures. The first&mdash;the first real
adventure in which Billy Topsail was abandoned
to his own wit and strength&mdash;came by reason of
a gust of wind and his own dog. It was not
strange that a gust of wind should overturn
Billy Topsail's punt; but that old Skipper should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
turn troublesome in the thick of the mess was an
event the most unexpected.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Skipper was a Newfoundland dog, born of reputable
parents at Back Arm and decently bred in
Ruddy Cove. He had black hair, short, straight
and wiry&mdash;the curly-haired breed has failed on
the Island&mdash;and broad, ample shoulders, which
his forbears had transmitted to him from generations
of hauling wood.</p>

<p>He was heavy, awkward and ugly, resembling
somewhat a great draft-horse. But he
pulled with a will, fended for himself, and within
the knowledge of men had never stolen a fish; so
he had a high place in the hearts of all the people
of the Cove, and a safe one in their estimation.</p>

<p>"Skipper! Skipper! Here, b'y!"</p>

<p>The ringing call, in the voice of Billy Topsail,
never failed to bring the dog from the kitchen
with an eager rush, when the snow lay deep on the
rocks, and all the paths of the wilderness were ready
for the sled. He stood stock-still for the harness,
and at the first "Hi, b'y! Gee up there!" he
bounded away with a wagging tail and a glad bark.
It was as if nothing pleased him so much on a frosty
morning as the prospect of a hard day's work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>If the call came in summer-time when Skipper
was dozing in the cool shadow of a flake&mdash;a
platform of boughs for drying fish&mdash;he scrambled
to his feet, took his clog<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> in his mouth and ran,
all a-quiver for what might come, to where young
Billy waited. If the clog were taken off, as it
was almost sure to be, it meant sport in the
water. Then Skipper would paw the ground
and whine until the stick was flung out for him.
But best of all he loved to dive for stones.</p>

<p>At the peep of many a day, too, he went out
in the punt to the fishing-grounds with Billy
Topsail, and there kept the lad good company
all the day long. It was because he sat on the
little cuddy in the bow, as if keeping a lookout
ahead, that he was called Skipper.</p>

<p>"Sure, 'tis a clever dog, that!" was Billy's
boast. "He would save life&mdash;that dog would!"</p>

<p>This was proved beyond doubt when little
Isaiah Tommy Goodman toddled over the wharf-head,
where he had been playing with a squid.
Isaiah Tommy was four years old, and would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
surely have been drowned had not Skipper
strolled down the wharf just at that moment.</p>

<p>Skipper was obedient to the instinct of all Newfoundland
dogs to drag the sons of men from
the water. He plunged in and caught Isaiah
Tommy by the collar of his pinafore. Still following
his instinct, he kept the child's head
above water with powerful strokes of his fore
paws while he towed him to shore. Then the
outcry which Isaiah Tommy immediately set up
brought his mother to complete the rescue.</p>

<p>For this deed Skipper was petted for a day
and a half, and fed with fried caplin and salt
pork, to his evident gratification. No doubt he
was persuaded that he had acted worthily.
However that be, he continued in merry moods,
in affectionate behaviour, in honesty&mdash;although
the fish were even then drying on the flakes, all
exposed&mdash;and he carried his clog like a hero.</p>

<p>"Skipper," Billy Topsail would ejaculate,
"you <em>do</em> be a clever dog!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One day in the spring of the year, when high
winds spring suddenly from the land, Billy Topsail
was fishing from the punt, the <i>Never Give
Up</i>, over the shallows off Molly's Head. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
"fish weather," as the Ruddy Cove men say&mdash;gray,
cold and misty. The harbour entrance lay
two miles to the southwest. The bluffs which
marked it were hardly discernible, for the mist
hung thick off the shore. Four punts and a
skiff were bobbing half a mile farther out to sea,
their crews fishing with hook and line over the
side. Thicker weather threatened and the day
was near spent.</p>

<p>"'Tis time to be off home, b'y," said Billy to
the dog. "'Tis getting thick in the sou'west."</p>

<p>Skipper stretched himself and wagged his tail.
He had no word to say, but Billy, who, like all
fishermen in remote places, had formed the habit
of talking to himself, supplied the answer.</p>

<p>"'Tis that, Billy, b'y," said he. "The punt's
as much as one hand can manage in a fair wind.
An' 'tis a dead beat to the harbour now."</p>

<p>Then Billy said a word for himself. "We'll
put in for ballast. The punt's too light for a
gale."</p>

<p>He sculled the punt to the little cove by the
Head, and there loaded her with rocks. Her
sails, mainsail and tiny jib, were spread, and she
was pointed for Grassy Island, on the first leg of
her beat into the wind. By this time two other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
punts were under way, and the sails of the skiff
were fluttering as her crew prepared to beat
home for the night. The <i>Never Give Up</i> was
ahead of the fleet, and held her lead in such fine
fashion as made Billy Topsail's heart swell with
pride.</p>

<p>The wind had gained in force. It was sweeping
down from the hills in gusts. Now it fell to
a breeze, and again it came swiftly with angry
strength. Nor could its advance be perceived,
for the sea was choppy and the bluffs shielded
the inshore waters.</p>

<p>"We'll fetch the harbour on the next tack,"
Billy muttered to Skipper, who was whining in
the bow.</p>

<p>He put the steering oar hard alee to bring the
punt about. A gust caught the sails. The boat
heeled before it, and her gunwale was under water
before Billy could make a move to save her.
The wind forced her down, pressing heavily upon
the canvas.</p>

<p>"Easy!" screamed Billy.</p>

<p>But the ballast of the <i>Never Give Up</i> shifted,
and she toppled over. Boy and dog were thrown
into the sea&mdash;the one aft, the other forward.
Billy dived deep to escape entanglement with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
rigging of the boat. He had long ago learned
the lesson that presence of mind wins half the
fight in perilous emergencies. The coward miserably
perishes where the brave man survives.
With his courage leaping to meet his predicament,
he struck out for windward and rose to the
surface.</p>

<p>He looked about for the punt. She had been
heavily weighted with ballast, and he feared for
her. What was he to do if she had been too
heavily weighted? Even as he looked she sank.
She had righted under water; the tip of the mast
was the last he saw of her.</p>

<p>The sea&mdash;cold, fretful, vast&mdash;lay all about him.
The coast was half a mile to windward; the punts,
out to sea, were laboriously beating towards him,
and could make no greater speed. He had to
choose between the punts and the rocks.</p>

<p>A whine&mdash;with a strange note in it&mdash;attracted
his attention. The big dog had caught sight of
him, and was beating the water in a frantic effort
to approach quickly. But the dog had never
whined like that before.</p>

<p>"Hi, Skipper!" Billy called. "Steady, b'y!
Steady!"</p>

<p>Billy took off his boots as fast as he could.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
The dog was coming nearer, still whining
strangely, and madly pawing the water. Billy
was mystified. What possessed the dog? It was
as if he had been seized with a fit of terror. Was
he afraid of drowning? His eyes were fairly
flaring. Such a light had never been in them
before.</p>

<p>In the instant he had for speculation the boy
lifted himself high in the water and looked intently
into the dog's eyes. It was terror he saw
in them; there could be no doubt about that, he
thought. The dog was afraid for his life. At
once Billy was filled with dread. He could not
crush the feeling down. Afraid of Skipper&mdash;the
old, affectionate Skipper&mdash;his own dog, which he
had reared from a puppy! It was absurd.</p>

<p>But he <em>was</em> afraid, nevertheless&mdash;and he was
desperately afraid.</p>

<p>"Back, b'y!" he cried. "Get back, sir!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<div class='summary'><i>Concerning the Behaviour of Billy Topsail and
His Dog in the Water When the Never Give
Up Went to the Bottom, and Closing With an
Apology and a Wag of the Tail</i></div>


<div class='drop-cap'>IT chanced that Billy Topsail was a strong
swimmer. He had learned to swim where the
water is cold&mdash;cold, often, as the icebergs
stranded in the harbour can make it. The water
was bitter cold now; but he did not fear it; nor
did he doubt that he could accomplish the long
swim which lay before him. It was the unaccountable
behaviour of the dog which disturbed
him&mdash;his failure in obedience, which could not
be explained. The dog was now within three
yards, and excited past all reason.</div>

<p>"Back, sir!" Billy screamed. "Get back with
you!"</p>

<p>Skipper was not deterred by the command.
He did not so much as hesitate. Billy raised his
hand as if to strike him&mdash;a threatening gesture
which had sent Skipper home with his tail between
his legs many a time. But it had no effect
now.</p>

<p>"Get back!" Billy screamed again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>It was plain that the dog was not to be bidden.
Billy threw himself on his back, supported himself
with his hands and kicked at the dog with
his feet.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i001.jpg" width="500" height="322" alt="boy in surf iwth dog" />
<div class="caption">BILLY RAISED HIS HAND AS IF TO STRIKE HIM.</div>
</div>

<p>Skipper was blinded by the splashing. He
whined and held back. Then blindly he came
again. Billy moved slowly from him, head foremost,
still churning the water with his feet. But,
swimming thus, he was no match for the dog.
With his head thrown back to escape the blows,
Skipper forged after him. He was struck in the
jaws, in the throat, and again in the jaws. But
he pawed on, taking every blow without complaint,
and gaining inch by inch. Soon he was
so close that the lad could no longer move his
feet freely. Then the dog chanced to catch one
foot with his paw, and forced it under. Billy
could not beat him off.</p>

<p>No longer opposed, the dog crept up&mdash;paw
over paw, forcing the boy's body lower and
lower. His object was clear to Billy. Skipper,
frenzied by terror, the boy thought, would try to
save himself by climbing on his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Skipper!" he cried. "You'll drown me!
Get back!"</p>

<p>The futility of attempting to command obedience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
from a crazy dog struck Billy Topsail
with force. He must act otherwise, and that
quickly, if he were to escape. There seemed
to be but one thing to do. He took a long
breath and let himself sink&mdash;down&mdash;down&mdash;as
deep as he dared. Down&mdash;down&mdash;until he retained
breath sufficient but to strike to the right
and rise again.</p>

<p>The dog&mdash;as it was made known later&mdash;rose
as high as he could force himself, and looked
about in every direction, with his mouth open
and his ears rigidly cocked. He gave two sharp
barks, like sobs, and a long, mournful whine.
Then, as if acting upon sudden thought, he dived.</p>

<p>For a moment nothing was to be seen of
either boy or dog. There was nothing but a
choppy sea in that place. Men who were watching
thought that both had followed the <i>Never
Give Up</i> to the bottom.</p>

<p>In the momentary respite under water Billy
perceived that his situation was desperate. He
would rise, he was sure, but only to renew the
struggle. How long he could keep the dog off
he could not tell. Until the punts came down
to his aid? He thought not.</p>

<p>He came to the surface prepared to dive again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
But Skipper had disappeared. An ejaculation
of thanksgiving was yet on the boy's lips when
the dog's black head rose and moved swiftly towards
him. Billy had a start of ten yards&mdash;or
something more.</p>

<p>He turned on his side and set off at top speed.
There was no better swimmer among the lads of
the harbour. Was he a match for a powerful
Newfoundland dog? It was soon evident that
he was not.</p>

<p>Skipper gained rapidly. Billy felt a paw
strike his foot. He put more strength into his
strokes. Next the paw struck the calf of his leg.
The dog was upon him now&mdash;pawing his back.
Billy could not sustain the weight. To escape,
that he might take up the fight in another way,
he dived again.</p>

<p>The dog was waiting when Billy came up&mdash;waiting
eagerly, on the alert to continue the chase.</p>

<p>"Skipper, old fellow&mdash;good old dog!" Billy
called in a soothing voice. "Steady, sir! Down,
sir&mdash;back!"</p>

<p>The dog was not to be deceived. He came,
by turns whining and gasping. He was more
excited, more determined, than ever. Billy
waited for him. The fight was to be face to face.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
The boy had determined to keep him off with his
hands until strength failed&mdash;to drown him if he
could. All love for the dog had gone out of his
heart. The weeks of close and merry companionship,
of romps and rambles and sport, were
forgotten. Billy was fighting for life. So he
waited without pity, hoping only that his strength
might last until he had conquered.</p>

<p>When the dog was within reach Billy struck
him in the face. A snarl and an angry snap were
the result.</p>

<p>Rage seemed suddenly to possess the dog. He
held back for a moment, growling fiercely, and
then attacked with a rush. Billy fought as best
he could, trying to clutch his enemy by the neck
and to force his head beneath the waves. The
effort was vain; the dog eluded his grasp and
renewed the attack. In another moment he had
laid his heavy paws on the boy's shoulders.</p>

<p>The weight was too much for Billy. Down he
went; freed himself, and struggled to the surface,
gasping for breath. It appeared to him now
that he had but a moment to live. He felt his
self-possession going from him&mdash;and at that
moment his ears caught the sound of a voice.</p>

<p>"Put your arm&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>The voice seemed to come from far away. Before
the sentence was completed, the dog's paws
were again on Billy's shoulders and the water
stopped the boy's hearing. What were they
calling to him? The thought that some helping
hand was near inspired him. With this new
courage to aid, he dived for the third time. The
voice was nearer&mdash;clearer&mdash;when he came up,
and he heard every word.</p>

<p>"Put your arm around his neck!" one man
cried.</p>

<p>"Catch him by the scruff of the neck!" cried
another.</p>

<p>Billy's self-possession returned. He would
follow this direction. Skipper swam anxiously
to him. It may be that he wondered what this
new attitude meant. It may be that he hoped
reason had returned to the boy&mdash;that at last he
would allow himself to be saved. Billy caught
the dog by the scruff of the neck when he was
within arm's length. Skipper wagged his tail
and turned about.</p>

<p>There was a brief pause, during which the
faithful old dog determined upon the direction
he would take. He espied the punts, which had
borne down with all speed. Towards them he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
swam, and there was something of pride in his
mighty strokes, something of exultation in his
whine. Billy struck out with his free hand, and
soon boy and dog were pulled over the side of
the nearest punt.</p>

<p>Through it all, as Billy now knew, the dog had
only wanted to save him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That night Billy Topsail took Skipper aside for
a long and confidential talk. "Skipper," said
he, "I beg your pardon. You see, I didn't know
what 'twas you wanted. I'm sorry I ever had a
hard thought against you, and I'm sorry I tried
to drown you. When I thought you only
wanted to save yourself, 'twas Billy Topsail you
were thinking of. When I thought you wanted
to climb atop of me, 'twas my collar you wanted
to catch. When I thought you wanted to bite
me, 'twas a scolding you were giving me for my
foolishness. Skipper, b'y, honest, I beg your
pardon. Next time I'll know that all a Newfoundland
dog wants is half a chance to tow me
ashore. And I'll give him a whole chance.
But, Skipper, don't you think you might have
given me a chance to do something for myself?"</p>

<p>At which Skipper wagged his tail.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<div class='summary'><i>Describing the Haunts and Habits of Devil-Fish
and Informing the Reader of Billy Topsail's
Determination to Make a Capture at all
Hazards</i></div>


<div class='drop-cap'>WHEN the Minister of Justice for the
colony of Newfoundland went away
from Ruddy Cove by the bay steamer,
he chanced to leave an American magazine at
the home of Billy Topsail's father, where he had
passed the night. The magazine contained an
illustrated article on the gigantic species of
cephalopods<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> popularly known as devil-fish.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>Billy Topsail did not know what a cephalopod
was; but he did know a squid when he saw its
picture, for Ruddy Cove is a fishing harbour,
and he had caught many a thousand for bait.
So when he found that to the lay mind a squid
and a cephalopod were one and the same, save
in size, he read the long article from beginning to
end, doing the best he could with the strange,
long words.</p>

<p>So interested was he that he read it again;
and by that time he had learned enough to surprise
him, even to terrify him, notwithstanding
the writer's assurance that the power and ferocity
of the creatures had generally been exaggerated.</p>

<p>He was a lad of sound common sense. He
had never wholly doubted the tales of desperate
encounters with devil-fish, told in the harbour
these many years; for the various descriptions of
how the long, slimy arms had curled about the
punts had rung too true to be quite disbelieved;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
but he had considered them somewhat less credible
than certain wild yarns of shipwreck, and
somewhat more credible than the bedtime stories
of mermaids which the grandmothers told the
children of the place.</p>

<p>Here, however, in plain print, was described
the capture of a giant squid in a bay which lay
beyond a point of land that Billy could see from
the window.</p>

<p>That afternoon Billy put out in his leaky old
punt to "jig" squid for bait. He was so disgusted
with the punt&mdash;so ashamed of the squat,
weather-worn, rotten cast-off&mdash;that he wished
heartily for a new one all the way to the
grounds. The loss of the <i>Never Give Up</i> had
brought him to humiliating depths.</p>

<p>But when he had once joined the little fleet of
boats, he cheerfully threw his grapnel into Bobby
Lot's punt and beckoned Bobby aboard. Then,
as together they drew the writhing-armed, squirting
little squids from the water, he told of the
"big squids" which lurked in the deep water
beyond the harbour; and all the time Bobby
opened his eyes wider and wider.</p>

<p>"Is they just like squids?" Bobby asked.</p>

<p>"But bigger," answered Billy. "Their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
bodies is so big as hogsheads. Their arms is
thirty-five feet long."</p>

<p>Bobby picked a squid from the heap in the
bottom of the boat. It had instinctively turned
from a reddish-brown to a livid green, the colour
of sea-water; indeed, had it been in the water,
its enemy would have had hard work to see it.</p>

<p>He handled it gingerly; but the ugly little
creature managed somehow to twine its slender
arms about his hand, and swiftly to take hold with
a dozen cup-like suckers. The boy uttered an
exclamation of disgust, and shook it off. Then
he shuddered, laughed at himself, shuddered
again. A moment later he chose a dead squid
for examination.</p>

<p>"Leave us look at it close," said he. "Then
we'll know what a real devil-fish is like. Sure,
I've been wantin' to know that for a long, long
time."</p>

<p>They observed the long, cylindrical body,
flabby and cold, with the broad, flap-like tail
attached. The head was repulsively ugly&mdash;perhaps
because of the eyes, which were disproportionately
large, brilliant, and, in the live
squid, ferocious.</p>

<p>A group of arms&mdash;two long, slender, tentacular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
arms, and eight shorter, thicker ones&mdash;projected
from the region of the mouth, which, indeed,
was set in the centre of the ring they formed
at the roots. They were equipped with innumerable
little suckers, were flexible and active,
and as long as the head, body and tail put together.</p>

<p>Closer examination revealed that there was a
horny beak, like a parrot's, in the mouth, and
that on the under side of the head was a curious
tube-like structure.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's his squirter!" Billy explained.
"When he wants to back up he points that forward,
and squirts out water so hard as he can;
and when he wants to go ahead he points it
backward, and does the same thing. That's
where his ink comes from, too, when he wants to
make the water so dirty nobody can see him."</p>

<p>"What does he do with his beak?"</p>

<p>"When he gets his food in his arms he bites
out pieces with his beak. He hasn't any teeth;
but he's got something just as good&mdash;a tongue
like a rasp."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't like to be cotched by a squid as
big as a hogshead," Bobby remarked, timidly.</p>

<p>"Hut!" said Billy, grimly. "He'd make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
short work o' <em>you!</em> Why, b'y, they weighs half
a ton apiece! I isn't much afraid, though," he
added. "They're only squid. Afore I read
about them in the book I used to think they was
worse than they is&mdash;terrible ghostlike things.
But they're no worse than squids, only bigger,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They're bad enough for <em>me</em>," Bobby interrupted.</p>

<p>"And," Billy concluded, "they only comes up
in the night or when they're sore wounded and
dyin'."</p>

<p>"I'm not goin' out at night, if I can help it,"
said Bobby, with a canny shake of the head.</p>

<p>"If they was a big squid come up the harbour
to your house," said Billy, after a pause, "and
got close to the rock, he could put one o'
they two long arms in your bedroom window,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Tis in the attic!"</p>

<p>"Never mind that. He could put it in the
window and feel around for your bed, and twist
that arm around you, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'd cut it off!"</p>

<p>"Anyhow, that's how long they is. And if he
knowed you was there, and wanted you, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
could get you. But I'm not so sure that he
<em>would</em> want you. He couldn't see you, anyhow;
and if he could, he'd rather have a good fat
salmon."</p>

<p>Bobby shuddered as he looked at the tiny
squid in his hand, and thought of the dreadful
possibilities in one a thousand times as big.</p>

<p>"You leave them alone, and they'll leave you
alone," Billy went on. "But if you once make
them mad, they can dart their arms out like
lightning. 'Tis time to get, then!"</p>

<p>"I'm goin' to keep an axe in my punt after
this," said Bobby, "and if I sees an arm slippin'
out of the water&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Tis as big as your thigh!" cried Billy.</p>

<p>"Never mind. If I sees it I'll be able to cut it
off."</p>

<p>"If I sees one," said Billy, "I'm goin' to cotch
it. It said in the book that they was worth a lot
to some people. And if I can sell mine I'm goin'
to have a new punt."</p>

<p>But although Bobby Lot and Billy Topsail
kept a sharp lookout for giant squids wherever
they went, they were not rewarded. There was
not so much as a sign of one. By and by, so
bold did they become, they hunted for one in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
twilight of summer days, even daring to pry into
the deepest coves and holes in the Ruddy Cove
rocks.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the ridicule he had to meet,
Bobby never ventured out in the punt without a
sharp axe. He could not tell what time he would
need it, he said; and thus he formed the habit of
making sure that it was in its place before casting
off from the wharf.</p>

<p>As autumn drew near they found other things
to think of; the big squids passed out of mind
altogether.</p>

<p>"Wonderful queer," Billy said, long afterwards,
"how things happen when you isn't expectin'
them!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<div class='summary'><i>Recounting the Adventure of the Giant Squid of
Chain Tickle, in Which the Punt Gets in the
Grip of a Gigantic Tentacle and Billy Topsail
Strikes With an Axe</i></div>


<div class='drop-cap'>ONE day late in September&mdash;it was near
evening of a gray day&mdash;Billy Topsail and
Bobby Lot were returning in Bobby's
punt from Birds' Nest Islands, whither they had
gone to hunt a group of seals, reported to have
taken up a temporary residence there. They
had a mighty, muzzle-loading, flintlock gun;
and they were so delighted with the noise it
made that they had exhausted their scanty provision
of powder and lead long before the seals
were in sight.</div>

<p>They had taken the shortest way home. It
lay past Chain Hole, a small, landlocked basin,
very deep, with a narrow entrance, which was
shallow at low tide. The entrance opened into a
broad bay, and was called Chain Tickle.</p>

<p>"What's that in the tickle?" Billy exclaimed,
as they were rowing past.</p>

<p>It was a black object, apparently floating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
quietly on the surface of the water. The boys
gazed at it for a long time, but could make nothing
of it. They were completely puzzled.</p>

<p>"'Tis a small bit o' wreck, I'm thinkin'," said
Bobby. "Leave us row close and see."</p>

<p>"Maybe 'tis a capsized punt."</p>

<p>When they were within about thirty yards of
the object they lay on their oars. For some unaccountable
reason they did not care to venture
nearer. Twilight was then fast approaching.
The light was already beginning to fail.</p>

<p>"'Tis a wonderful queer thing!" Billy muttered,
his curiosity getting the better of him.
"Row ahead, Bobby. We'll go alongside."</p>

<p>"They's something movin' on it!" Bobby
whispered, as he let his oars fall in the water.
"Look! They's two queer, big, round spots on
it&mdash;big as plates."</p>

<p>Billy thought he saw the whole object move.
He watched it closely. It <em>did</em> stir! It was some
living thing, then. But what? A whale?</p>

<p>A long, snakelike arm was lifted out of the
water. It swayed this way and that, darted here
and there, and fell back with a splash. The
moving spots, now plainly gigantic eyes, glittered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Tis the devil-fish!" screamed Bobby.</p>

<p>Another arm was lifted up, then a third and a
fourth and a fifth. The monster began to lash
the water&mdash;faster and yet more furiously&mdash;until
the tickle was heaving and frothy, and the whole
neighbourhood was in an uproar.</p>

<p>"Pull! Pull!" cried Bobby.</p>

<p>Billy, too, was in a panic. They turned the
head of the punt and pulled with all their might.
The water swirled in the wake of the boat. Perceiving,
however, that the squid made no effort
to follow, they got the better of their fright
Then they lay on their oars to watch the monster.</p>

<p>They wondered why it still lay in the tickle,
why it so furiously lashed the water with its
arms and great tail. It was Bobby who solved
the mystery.</p>

<p>"'Tis aground," said he.</p>

<p>That was evidently the situation. The squid
had been caught in the shallow tickle when the
tide, which ran swiftly at that point, was on the
ebb. The boys took courage. Their curiosity
still further emboldened them. So once more
they turned the punt about and pulled cautiously
towards the tickle.</p>

<p>There was less light than before, but still sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
to disclose the baleful eyes and writhing
arms of the squid when the boat was yet a safe
distance away. One by one the arms fell back
into the water, as if from exhaustion; slowly the
beating of the tail subsided. After a time all
sound and motion ceased. The boys waited for
some further sign of life, but none came. The
squid was still, as if dead.</p>

<p>"Sure, he's dead now," said Billy. "Leave
us pull close up."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, b'y! He's but makin' believe."</p>

<p>But Billy thought otherwise. "I wants that
squid," he said, in a dogged way, "and I'm
goin' to have him. I'll sell him and get a new
punt."</p>

<p>Bobby protested in vain. Nothing would content
Billy Topsail but the possession of the big
squid's body. Bobby pointed out that if the
long, powerful arms were once laid on the boat
there would be no escape. He recalled to Billy
the harbour story of the horrible death of Zachariah
North, who, as report said, had been pursued,
captured and pulled under water by a
devil-fish in Gander Bay.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>It was all to no purpose, however, for Billy
obstinately declared that he would make sure of
the squid before the tide turned. He admitted a
slight risk, but he wanted a new punt, and he
was willing to risk something to obtain it.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i002.jpg" width="500" height="434" alt="rowboat facing large octopus" />
<div class="caption">THEN LIKE A FLASH IT SHOT TOWARD THE BOAT.</div>
</div>

<p>He proposed to put Bobby ashore, and approach
the squid alone; but Bobby would not
listen. Two hands might be needed in the boat,
he said. What if the squid were alive, after all?
What if it laid hold of the punt? In that event,
two hands would surely be needed.</p>

<p>"I'll go," he said. "But leave us pull slow.
And if we sees so much as a wink of his eye we'll
pull away."</p>

<p>They rowed nearer, with great caution. Billy
was in the bow of the boat. It was he who had
the axe. Bobby, seated amidships, faced the bow.
It was he who did the rowing.</p>

<p>The squid was quiet. There was not a sign
of life about it. Billy estimated the length of its
body, from the beak to the point of the tail, as
twenty feet, the circumference as "the size of a
hogshead." Its tentacular arms, he determined,
must be at least thirty-five feet long; and when
the boat came within that distance he shuddered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is you sure he's dead?" Bobby whispered,
weakly.</p>

<p>"I don't know!" Billy answered, in a gasp.
"I thinks so."</p>

<p>Bobby dropped the oars and stepped to the
bow of the punt. The boat lost way and came
to a stop within twenty feet of the squid. Still
there was no sign of life.</p>

<p>The boys stared at the great, still body, lying
quiet in the gathering dusk and haze. Neither
seemed to feel the slight trembling of the boat
that might have warned them. Not a word was
spoken until Billy, in a whisper, directed Bobby
to pull the boat a few feet nearer.</p>

<p>"But we're movin' already," he added, in a
puzzled way.</p>

<p>The boat was very slowly approaching the
squid. The motion was hardly perceptible, but
it was real.</p>

<p>"'Tis queer!" said Bobby.</p>

<p>He turned to take up the oars. What he saw
lying over the port gunwale of the boat made
him gasp, grip Billy's wrist and utter a scream
of terror!</p>

<p>"We're cotched!"</p>

<p>The squid had fastened one of its tentacles to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
the punt. The other was poised above the stern,
ready to fall and fix its suckers. The onward
movement of the punt was explained.</p>

<p>Billy knew the danger, but he was not so terrified
as to be incapable of action. He was about
to spring to the stem to strike off the tentacle
that already lay over the gunwale; but as he
looked down to choose his step he saw that one
of the eight powerful arms was slowly creeping
over the starboard bow.</p>

<p>He struck at that arm with all his might,
missed, wrenched the axe from the gunwale, and
struck true. The mutilated arm was withdrawn.
Billy leaped to the stern, vaguely conscious in
passing that another arm was creeping from the
water. He severed the first tentacle with one
blow. When he turned to strike the second it
had disappeared; so, too, had the second arm.
The boat seemed to be free, but it was still within
grasp.</p>

<p>In the meantime the squid had awakened to
furious activity. It was lashing the water with
arms and tail, angrily snapping its great beak
and ejecting streams of black water from its
siphon-tube. The water was violently agitated
and covered with a black froth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>In this the creature manifested fear and distress.
Had it not been aground it would have
backed swiftly into the deep water of the basin.
But, as if finding itself at bay, it lifted its uninjured
tentacle high above the boat. Billy made
ready to strike.</p>

<p>By this time Bobby had mastered his terror.
While Billy stood with uplifted axe, his eyes fixed
on the waving tentacle overhead, Billy heaved
mightily on the oars. The boat slowly drew away
from that highly dangerous neighbourhood. In
a moment it was beyond reach of the arms, but
still, apparently, within reach of the tentacle.
The tentacle was withdrawn a short distance;
then like a flash it shot towards the boat, writhing
as it came.</p>

<p>Billy struck blindly&mdash;and struck nothing. The
tentacle had fallen short. The boat was out of
danger!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But still Billy Topsail was determined to have
the body of the squid. Notwithstanding Bobby's
pleading and protestation, he would not abandon
his purpose. He was only the more grimly bent
on achieving it. Bobby would not hear of again
approaching nearer than the boat then floated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
nor did Billy think it advisable. But it occurred
to Bobby that they might land, and approach
the squid from behind. If they could draw near
enough, he said, they could cast the grapnel on
the squid's back, and moor it to a tree ashore.</p>

<p>"Sure," he said, excitedly, "you can pick up
a squid from behind, and it can't touch you with
its arms! It won't be able to see us, and it won't
be able to reach us."</p>

<p>So they landed. Billy carried the grapnel,
which was attached to twelve fathoms of line.
It had six prongs, and each prong was barbed.</p>

<p>A low cliff at the edge of the tickle favoured
the plan. The squid lay below, and some twenty
feet out from the rock. It was merely a question
of whether or not Billy was strong enough
to throw the grapnel so far. They tied the end
of the line to a stout shrub. Billy cast the grapnel,
and it was a strong, true cast. The iron fell
fair on the squid's back. It was a capture.</p>

<p>"That means a new punt for me," said Billy,
quietly. "The tide'll not carry <em>that</em> devil-fish
away."</p>

<p>"And now," Bobby pleaded, "leave us make
haste home, for 'tis growin' wonderful dark&mdash;and&mdash;and
there might be another somewhere."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>So that is how one of the largest specimens of
<i>Architeuthis princeps</i>&mdash;enumerated in Prof. John
Adam Wright's latest monograph on the cephalopods
of North America as the "Chain Tickle
specimen"&mdash;was captured. And that is how
Billy Topsail fairly won a new punt; for when
Doctor Marvey, the curator of the Public Museum
at St. John's&mdash;who is deeply interested in
the study of the giant squids&mdash;came to Ruddy
Cove to make photographs and take measurements,
in response to a message from Billy's
father, he rewarded the lad.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<div class='summary'><i>On the Face of the Cliff: Wherein Billy Topsail
Gets Lost in a Perilous Place and Sits Down to
Recover His Composure</i></div>


<div class='drop-cap'>IN summer, when there chanced to be no fish,
or when no bait was to be had, and the fish
were not to be jigged, Billy Topsail had idle
time, which he was not slow to improve for his
own amusement. Often he wandered on the
cliffs and heads near the harbour&mdash;not always for
gulls' eggs: sometimes for sheer love of the sky
and space and sunlit air. Once, being bound for
Breakheart Head, to watch the waves beat on
the rocks below, he came across old Arch Butt.</div>

<p>"Wonderful sea outside," said the old fisherman.
"Wonderful sea, Billy. 'Tis as big a
tumble as ever I seed stirred up in a night."</p>

<p>"An' you'll not be takin' the punt t' the
grounds?" Billy asked, in surprise.</p>

<p>"I'm not able, lad. 'Tis too much for any
paddle-punt. Sure, the sea's breakin' right
across the tickle. 'Tis so much as a man's life is
worth t' try t' run out."</p>

<p>"Isn't you got a salmon net off Shag Rock?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"I is that," Arch answered; "an' I'm wantin'
bad t' get to it. 'Tis set off the point of Shag
Rock, an' I'm thinkin' the sea will wreck it, for
'tis a wonderful tumble, indeed. 'Tis like I'll not
be able t' get out afore to-morrow mornin', but
I'm hopin' I will."</p>

<p>"An' I hopes you may, Skipper Arch," said
Billy.</p>

<p>It was a fine wish, born of the fresh breeze and
brightness of the day&mdash;a word let drop from a
heart full of good feeling for all the world: nothing
more. Yet within a few hours Billy Topsail's
life hung upon the possibility of its fulfillment.</p>

<p>"Ay," he repeated, "I hopes you may."</p>

<p>Billy Topsail followed the rocky road to the
Bath Tub, climbed the Lookout, and descended
the rough declivity beyond to the edge of the
sea, meanwhile lifted to a joyous mood by the
sunlight and wind and cloudless sky. Indeed,
he was not sorry he had come; the grim cliffs
and the jagged masses of rock lying at their
feet&mdash;the thunder and froth where sea met rock&mdash;the
breaking, flashing water to seaward; all this
delighted him then, and were not soon forgotten.
Best of all, the third submerged rock off Shag
Cliff&mdash;the rock they call the Tombstone&mdash;was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
breaking; the greater waves there leaped into
the air in fountains of froth.</p>

<p>"I 'low I'll get closer t' the Tombstone,"
thought he.</p>

<p>Thus he was led along the coast to the foot of
Shag Cliff. It was a hard climb, in which hands
and feet were both concerned. There were
chasms to leap, sharp points to round, great
rocks to scale, narrow ledges to pass over on the
toes of his boots; and all the while the breakers
were crashing and foaming below him, and now
and again splashing him with spray.</p>

<p>Had the day been drear, it may be he would
not have ventured so far; but the sun was out,
the day long, the gulls quietly soaring over the
sea, and on he went, giving no thought whatever
to his return.</p>

<p>Once under the cliff, he ventured farther. Detached
from it, there lies Nanny's Rock, which
must long ago have fallen from above; the
breakers surrounded but did not sweep it when
they rose and broke.</p>

<p>His wish to lie there in the sunshine, with the
blue sky above him and the noise of the water in
his ears, led him to dash across the dripping
space between when the wave fell back, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
though he must scramble out of the way of the
returning water.</p>

<p>In a few minutes he was deep in an enchanting
day-dream, which, to his subsequent peril,
soon changed to sleep.</p>

<p>The tide was rising. A few drops of spray,
falling upon his face from a great breaker, awoke
him. On the instant he was wide awake and
looking desperately about. Then he laughed to
think that the breakers were reaching for him&mdash;that
they would have had him fast in the trap
had he slept much longer; for, in a glance, he
thought he had made sure that his escape from
the rock was not yet cut off. But his laugh was
touched with some embarrassment when he found,
upon trial, that the sea had blocked the path by
which he had reached the foot of Shag Cliff.</p>

<p>"I must go 'tother way," he thought.</p>

<p>There was no other way; to right and to left
the sea was breaking against overhanging juts
of rock. He could pass from jut to jut, but he
could round neither.</p>

<p>"Sure, I'll be late for dinner," he thought; "an'
dad won't like it."</p>

<p>It was all very well to exclaim vexatiously,
but he was forced to abandon the hope of returning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
by way of the foot of the cliffs. The tide had
cut him off.</p>

<p>"I'll scale Shag Cliff," he determined.</p>

<p>He was not alarmed; the situation was awkward,
but it promised the excitement of an adventure,
and for a time he was rather glad that he
had fallen asleep. To scale the two hundred
feet of Shag Cliff&mdash;that was something to
achieve! His father would say that he was
"narvy," and forget that he had kept him from
his dinner. Scale Shag Cliff, by all means!</p>

<p>He knew well enough that he had but to seek
higher ground and wait for the tide to fall, if he
wanted an unexciting return; but it pleased him
to make believe that his situation was desperate&mdash;that
the rising water would overwhelm him if
he did not escape over the brow of the cliff: an
indulgence which his imagination did not need
half an hour later. When he looked up, however,
to choose a path of ascent, he found that,
from where he stood, close against the cliff at the
base, there seemed to be no path at all.</p>

<p>"I 'low I'll have t' go back t' Nanny's Rock
for a better squint," he told himself.</p>

<p>Back to Nanny's Rock he went, at no small
risk, for the occasional flow of foam, which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
cut it off from the mainland when first he crossed,
had swollen to a strait of some depth and
strength. He must make the leap, but he dreaded
it. There was a moment of terror when his foot
slipped, and he came near falling back into the
very claws of the breaker which followed him;
on that account, perhaps, his survey of the face
of the cliff was a hurried one, and his return to
safe ground precipitate and somewhat flurried.</p>

<p>He had seen enough, however, to persuade
him that the ascent would be comparatively easy
for at least a hundred feet, and that, for the rest
of the way, it would not, probably, be much more
difficult.</p>

<p>In point of fact, he knew nothing whatever of
what lay beyond the first hundred feet. But the
element of probability, or rather improbability,
did not disconcert him. He could at least make
a start.</p>

<p>If you have ever climbed about a rocky sea-coast,
you will know that an ascent may be comparatively
simple where a descent is quite impracticable;
you will know that the unwary may
of a sudden reach a point where to continue the
climb is a nauseating necessity. There are times
when one regrets the courage that led him into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
his difficulty&mdash;the courage or the carelessness, as
the case may be.</p>

<p>Experience had long ago taught Billy Topsail
that; but the lesson had not been severe&mdash;there
had been no gulf behind him; the whip of life or
death had not urged him on. Indeed, he had
never attempted a climb of such height and ugly
possibilities in the way of blind leads as Shag
Cliff, else possibly he should not have made the
start with a sense of adventure so inspiring.</p>

<p>Up he went&mdash;up and still up, his cheeks glowing,
his nerves pleasurably tingling! Up&mdash;up
and still up, until he could hear the whiz of gulls'
wings near him, and the feeling of space below
began to try his nerves. At last he stopped to
rest and look about. Down deep lay the
breakers, so far off, it seemed, that he marvelled
he could hear the roar and crash so distinctly.</p>

<p>"An' they says 'tis a hundred feet!" thought
he. "Hut! 'Tis two hundred if 'tis an inch.
An' I isn't but half way up!"</p>

<p>Beyond that point his difficulties began. The
cliff was bolder; it was almost bare of those little
ledges and crevices and projections upon which
the cliff-climber depends for handhold and foothold.
Moreover, the path was interrupted from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
time to time by sheer or overhanging rock.
When he came to these impassable places, of
course, he turned to right or left, content with his
progress if only he mounted higher and higher.
Thus he strayed far off the path he had picked
out from Nanny's Rock; indeed, he was climbing
blindly, a thoughtless course, for&mdash;had he but
stopped to think&mdash;there was no knowing that the
cliff did not overhang at the end of the way he
had taken.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, time was passing. He had climbed
with such caution, retraced his steps, changed his
course so often that noon was long past. So
when next he came to a roomy ledge he sat down
to rest before proceeding farther.</p>

<p>"Wonderful queer!" he thought, after a look
about. "But where is I?"</p>

<p>It was a puzzling question. The cliff, projecting
below him, cut off his view of the breakers;
and the rock above, which came to an end in
blue sky, was of course unfamiliar. At what
part of Shag Rock he then was he could not tell.</p>

<div class='summary'><i>In Which Billy Topsail Loses His Nerve.

Topsail. "Lost on a cliff! 'Tis the
queerest thing I ever knowed."</div>

<p>But that was Billy's case.</p>

<p>"I 'low," he concluded, at last, "that I'd better

<p>It did not appear that he would be unable to
go down; the way up was the shorter way, that
was all. Nevertheless, his feeling of security was
pretty well shaken when he again began to
climb. His grip was tighter, his shrinking from
the depths stronger and more frequent; in fact,
he hugged the rock more than was good for him.</p>

<p>He knew the symptom for an alarming one&mdash;it
turned him faint when first he recognized it&mdash;and
he tried to fix his attention upon the effort
to climb higher. But now and again the fear of
the space behind and below would creep in.
Reason told him that the better part was to return;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
but he was in no condition to listen to reason.
His whole desire&mdash;it was fast becoming
frantic&mdash;was to crawl over the brow of the cliff
and be safe.</p>

<p>But where was the brow of the cliff? It
seemed to him that he had climbed a thousand
feet.</p>

<p>A few minutes later he caught sight of a
shrub; then he knew that he was within a few
feet of the end of the climb. The shrub&mdash;a
stunted spruce, which he had good reason to remember&mdash;was
to his right, peeping round a projection
of rock.</p>

<p>He was then on a ledge, with good foothold
and good handhold; and a way of return to the
shore lay open to him. By craning his neck he
made out that if he could pass that projection he
would reach shelving, broken rock, and be safe.
Then he studied the face of the rocks between&mdash;a
space of some six feet.</p>

<p>There was foothold there, midway, but he
shrank from attempting to reach it. He had
never thought in his life to try so perilous a passage.
A survey of the course of a body falling
from that point was almost more than he could
support. Nevertheless, strange as it may seem,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the waving shrub tempted him to risk something
more to end his suspense. He summoned
courage enough to stretch out his right foot and
search with his right hand for a hold.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, he found both&mdash;a ledge for his
foot and a crevice for his fingers.</p>

<p>He drew himself over. It took courage and
strength, for it was a long stretch. Had he been
cramped for room, had he not been free to move
at the starting-point, he could not have managed
it. But there he was&mdash;both feet on a ledge as
wide as his feet were long, both hands with a
comfortable grip on solid rock. He shuffled
along until he came to the end of the ledge.</p>

<p>His last obstacle now lay before him. He
must round the projection which divided him
from the broken, shelving rock beyond. Had
he foreseen the slightest difficulty he would not
have gone so far. So, with confidence, he
sought a foothold for his right foot&mdash;a crevice
for the fingers of his right hand.</p>

<p>And he tried again, with confidence unshaken;
again, with patience; again, with rising fear.
There was no hold; the passage was impracticable.
There was nothing for it but to return.</p>

<p>So he shuffled back to the other end of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
ledge. Then, keenly regretting the necessity of
return, he sought a foothold for his left foot&mdash;a
crevice for the fingers of his left hand. He tried
again, in some wonder; again, with a rush of
fear; again, in abject terror.</p>

<p>To his horror, he found that he could not return.
From the narrow ledge it was impossible
to pass to the wider, although it had been possible
to pass from the wider to the narrow. For
an instant he was on the point of toppling back;
but he let his body fall forward against the face
of the cliff, and there he rested, gripping the
rock with both hands until the faintness passed.</p>

<p>The situation was quite plain to him. He was
standing on a ledge, as wide as his feet were
long, some two or three hundred feet above the
sea; his face was to the cliff, and he could
neither sit down nor turn round. There he must
stand until&mdash;who could tell? In what way could
relief come to him? Who was to see? Who
could hear his cries for help? No fishermen
were on the grounds&mdash;no punts were out of the
harbour; the sea was too high for that, as he
had been told.</p>

<p>There was only one answer to his question.
He must stand until&mdash;he fell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," he was courageous enough to admit
calmly, "I 'low I got t' go."</p>

<p>That once admitted, his terror of that space
behind and below in some measure departed.
The sun was still shining; the sky&mdash;as he knew,
for he could catch a glimpse of it on each side&mdash;was
still blue. But soon he began to think of
the night; then his terror returned&mdash;not of the
present moment, but of the hours of darkness
approaching.</p>

<p>Could he endure until night? He thought
not. His position was awkward. Surely his
strength would wear out&mdash;his hands weaken, although
the strain upon them was slight; his legs
give way.</p>

<p>Of course he followed the natural impulse to
cling to his life as long as he could. Thus,
while the afternoon dragged along and the dusk
approached, he stood on the face of the cliff,
waiting for the moment when his weakening
strength would fail and he would fall to his
death.</p>

<p>"In an hour," he thought; soon it was, "In
half an hour."</p>

<p>Before that last half-hour had passed he felt
something brush past his back. It frightened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
him. What was it? Again he felt it. Again it
startled and frightened him. Then he felt it no
more for a time, and he was glad of that. He
was too dull, perhaps, to dwell upon the mystery
of that touch. It passed from his mind. Soon
he felt it for the third time. Was it a wing?
He wondered, too, if he had not heard a voice; for
it seemed to him that some one had hailed him.</p>

<p>When next he heard the sound, he knew that
his name had been called. He looked up. A
rope was hanging over the brow of the cliff,
sweeping slowly towards him. He could see it,
although the light was failing. When it came
near he extended his right hand behind him and
caught it, then gave it a tug, in signal to those
above that the search was ended. Painfully,
slowly, for his situation was none too secure, he
encircled his waist with that stout rope, lashed it
fast, shouted, "Haul away!" and fainted.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When Billy Topsail came to his senses, it was
to find himself lying on the moss, with old Arch,
the skipper, leaning over him, and half a dozen
fishermen gathered round.</p>

<p>"So you did get out to the salmon net?" he
muttered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"Aye," said Arch; "'twas I that seed you
hangin' there. Sure, if I hadn't had my net set
off Shag Rock, and if I hadn't got through the
tickle to see if 'twas all right, and if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Billy shuddered.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<div class='summary'><i>In Which Billy Topsail Hears the Fur Trader's
Story of a Jigger and a Cake of Ice in the
Wind</i></div>


<div class='drop-cap'>"WOULDN'T think I'd been born on
Cherry Hill, would you, now?" said
the man with the fur cap.</div>

<p>The stranger had been landed at Ruddy Cove
from Fortune Harbour. He had been in the far
north, he said; and he was now waiting for the
mail-boat to take him south. Billy Topsail and
the lads of Ruddy Cove cocked their ears for a
yarn.</p>

<p>"Fact!" said he, with a nod. "That's where
I was born and bred. And do you know how I
come to be away up here? No? Well, I'm a
fur trader. I'm the man that bought the skin of
that silver fox last winter for thirty dollars and
sold it for two hundred and fifty. I'd rather be
the man that bought it from me and sold it in
London for six hundred. But I'm not."</p>

<p>"And you're bound for home, now?" the old
skipper asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," he drawled. "I'm bound home for
New York to see the folks. I've been away six
years, and came nearer to leaving my bones up
here in the north last spring than ever I did before.
I've done some travelling in my time.
You can take me at my word; I have."</p>

<p>The trader laughed uproariously. He was in
a voluble mood. The old skipper knew that he
needed but little encouragement to tell the story
of his escape.</p>

<p>"It makes me think about that old riddle of
the corked bottle," he said. "Ever hear it?
This is it: If you had a bottle of ginger ale, how
would you get the stuff out without breaking the
bottle or drawing the cork? Can you answer
that?"</p>

<p>"The answer doesn't strike me," said the
skipper.</p>

<p>"That's just it," the trader burst out. "The
way to do it doesn't 'strike you.' But if you had
the bottle in your hands now and wanted the
ginger ale, it would 'strike' you fast enough to
push the cork in. Well, that was my case. You
think of yourself on a little pan of ice, drifting
straight out to sea with a strong offshore wind,
water all round you and no paddle&mdash;just think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
of yourself in that case, and a way of getting
ashore might not 'strike' you. But once you're
there&mdash;once you're right on that pan of ice, with
the hand of death on your collar&mdash;you'll think
like lightning of all the things you can do. Yes,
that was my case."</p>

<p>The listeners said nothing to interrupt the
stocky, hard-featured, ill-clad little man while he
mused.</p>

<p>"'Don't you be fool enough to try to cross the
bay this evening,' says I to myself," he went on.</p>

<p>"But I'm a hundred-mile man, and I'd gone
my hundred miles. I can carry grub on my back
to last me just that far; and my grub was out.
From what I knew of winds and ice, I judged
that the ice would be four or five miles out to
sea by dawn of the next day. So I didn't start
out with the idea that the trip would be as easy
as a promenade over Brooklyn Bridge of a moonlight
night. Oh, no! I knew what I was doing.
But it was a question of taking the risk or dragging
myself into the settlement at Racquet Harbour
in three days' time as lean as a car-horse
from starvation. You see, it was forty miles
round that bay and four across; and&mdash;my grub
was out. Many a man loses his life in these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
parts by looking at the question in just that
way.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 239px;">
<img src="images/i003.jpg" width="239" height="500" alt="man jumping for ice" />
<div class="caption">"JUMPED LIKE A STAG FOR THE SECOND PAN."</div>
</div>

<p>"'Oh, no!' says I to myself. 'You'd much better
take your chance of starving, and walk round.'</p>

<p>"It wasn't in human nature, though, to do it.
Not when I knew that there was grub and a
warm fire waiting for me at Racquet Harbour.
Says I, 'I'll take the long chance and stand to
win.' Don't you run away with the idea that the
ice was a level field stretching from shore to
shore, fitting the rocks, and kept as neat as a
baseball diamond. It wasn't. Some day in the
winter the wind had jammed the bay full of big
rough chunks&mdash;they call them pans in this country&mdash;and
the frost had stuck them all together.
When the spring came, of course the sun began
to melt that glue, and the whole floe was just
ready to fall apart when I had the bad luck to
make the coast. I was a day too late. I knew
it. And I knew that the offshore wind would
sweep the ice to sea the minute it broke up.</p>

<p>"I made the first hundred yards in ten minutes;
the second in fifteen more. In half an
hour I'd made half a mile. The ice was rough
enough and flimsy enough to take the nerve out
of any man. But that wasn't the worst; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
worst was that there were hundreds of holes covered
with a thin crust of snow&mdash;all right to look
at, but treacherous. I knew that if I made the
mistake of stepping on a crust instead of solid ice,
I'd go through and down.</p>

<p>"I had four otter skins, some martens and ten
fine fox skins in the pack on my back. To do
anything in the water with that handicap was too
much for me. So I wasn't at all particular about
making time until I found that the night would
catch me if I didn't wag along a little faster.</p>

<p>"No, sir!" the trader said. "I didn't want to
be caught out there in the dark.</p>

<p>"By good luck, I struck some big pans about
half-way over. Then I took to a dog-trot, and
left the yards behind me in a way that cheered
me up. Just before dusk I got near enough to
the other side to feel proud of myself, and I
began to think of what a fool I'd have been if
I'd taken the shore route. A minute later I
changed my mind. I felt the pack moving!
Well, in a flash I said good-bye to Cherry Hill
and the boys. Not many men are caught twice
in a place like that. They never have the second
chance.</p>

<p>"There I was, aboard a rotten floe and bound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
out to the big, lonely ocean at the rate of four
miles an hour.</p>

<p>"'Oh, you might as well get ready to go,
Jim,' thinks I. But I didn't give up. I loped
along shoreward in a way that didn't take snow
crust or air-holes into account. And I made the
edge of the floe before the black hours of the
night had come.</p>

<p>"There was a couple of hundred yards of cold
water between me and the shore.</p>

<p>"'This is the time you think more of your life
than your fur,' thinks I.</p>

<p>"There was a stray pan or two&mdash;little rafts of
things&mdash;lying off the edge of the floe; and beyond
them, scattered between the shore and me,
half a dozen other pans were floating. How to
get from one to the other was the puzzle. They
were fifty or sixty yards apart, most of them, and
I had no paddle. It was foolish to think of making
a shift with my jacket for a sail; the wind
was out, not in, and I had no rudder.</p>

<p>"What had I? Nothing that I could think of.
It didn't <em>strike</em> me, as you say. I wish it had.</p>

<p>"'Anyhow,' says I to myself, 'I'll get as far as
I can.'</p>

<p>"It was a short leap from the floe to the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
pan. I made it easily. The second pan was
farther off, but I thought I could jump the water
between. So I took off my pack and threw it on
the ice beside me. It almost broke my heart to
do it, for I'd walked five hundred miles in the
dead of winter for that fur; I'd been nearly
starved and frozen, and I'd paid out hard-earned
money. I put down my pack, took a short run,
and jumped like a stag for the second pan.</p>

<p>"I landed on the spot I'd picked out. I can't
complain of missing the mark, but instead of
stopping there, I shot clear through and down
into the water.</p>

<p>"Surprised? I was worse than that. I was
dead scared. For a minute I thought I was
going to rise under the ice and drown right there.</p>

<p>"How it happened I don't know; but I came
up between the pans, and struck out for the one
I'd left. I got to the pan, all right, and climbed
aboard. There I was, on a little pan of ice, beyond
reach of the floe and leaving the shore behind
me, and cold and pretty well discouraged.</p>

<p>"There's the riddle of the corked bottle," said
the trader, interrupting his narrative. "Now
how do I happen to be sitting here?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I can't tell," said the skipper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"No more you should," said he, "for you
don't know what I carried in my pack. But
you see I had the bottle in my hands, and I
wanted the ginger ale bad; so I thought fast and
hard.</p>

<p>"It struck me that I might do something with
my line and jigger.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Don't you see the chance
the barbed steel hooks and the forty fathom of
line gave me? When I thought of that jigger
I felt just like the man who is told to push the
cork in when he can't draw it out. I'd got back
to the pan where I'd thrown down my pack, you
know; so there was the jigger, right at hand.</p>

<p>"It was getting dark by this time&mdash;getting
dark fast, and the pans were drifting farther and
farther apart.</p>

<p>"It was easy to hook the jigger in the nearest
pan and draw my pan over to it; for that pan
was five times the weight of the one I was on.
The one beyond was about the same size; they
came together at the half-way point. Of course
this took time. I could hardly see the shore
then, and it struck me that I might not be able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
to find it at all, when I came near enough to cast
my jigger for it.</p>

<p>"About fifty yards off was a big pan. I swung
the jigger round and round and suddenly let the
line shoot through my fingers. When I hauled
it in the jigger came too, for it hadn't taken hold.
That made me feel bad. I felt worse when it
came back the second time. But I'm not one of
the kind that gives up. I kept right on casting
that jigger until it landed in the right spot.</p>

<p>"My pan crossed over as I hauled in the line.
That was all right; but there was no pan between
me and the shore.</p>

<p>"'All up!' thinks I.</p>

<p>"It was dark. I could see neither pan nor
shore. Before long I couldn't see a thing in the
pitchy blackness.</p>

<p>"All the time I could feel the pan humping
along towards the open sea. I didn't know how
far off the shore was. I was in doubt about just
where it was.</p>

<p>"'Is this pan turning round?' thinks I. Well,
I couldn't tell; but I thought I'd take a flier at
hooking a rock or a tree with the jigger.</p>

<p>"The jigger didn't take hold. I tried a dozen
times, and every time I heard it splash the water.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
But I kept on trying&mdash;and would have kept
on till morning if I'd needed to. You can take
me at my word, I'm not the kind of fool that
gives up&mdash;I've been in too many tight places
for that. So, at last, I gave the jigger a fling
that landed it somewhere where it held fast; but
whether ice or shore I couldn't tell. If shore, all
right; if ice, all wrong; and that's all I could do
about it.</p>

<p>"'Now,' thinks I, as I began to haul in, 'it all
depends on the fishing line. Will it break, or
won't it?'</p>

<p>"It didn't. So the next morning, with my
pack on my back, I tramped round the point to
Racquet Harbour."</p>

<p>"What was it?" was Billy Topsail's foolish
question. "Shore or ice?"</p>

<p>"If it hadn't been shore," said the trader, "I
wouldn't be here."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<div class='summary'><i>In the Offshore Gale: In Which Billy Topsail
Goes Seal Hunting and is Swept to Sea With
the Floe</i></div>


<div class='drop-cap'>WHAT befell old Tom Topsail and his
crew came in the course of the day's
work. Fishermen and seal-hunters,
such as the folk of Ruddy Cove, may not wait
for favourable weather; when the fish are running,
they must fish; when the seals are on the
drift-ice offshore in the spring, they must hunt.</div>

<p>So on that lowering day, when the seals were
sighted by the watch on Lookout Head, it was a
mere matter of course that the men of the place
should set out to the hunt.</p>

<p>"I s'pose," Tom Topsail drawled, "that we'd
best get under way."</p>

<p>Bill Watt, his mate, scanned the sky in the
northeast. It was heavy, cold and leaden; fluffy
gray towards the zenith, and black where the
clouds met the barren hills.</p>

<p>"I s'pose," said he, catching Topsail's drawl,
"that 'twill snow afore long."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, aye," was the slow reply, "I s'pose
'twill."</p>

<p>Again Bill Watt faced the sullen sky. He felt
that the supreme danger threatened&mdash;snow with
wind.</p>

<p>"I s'pose," he said, "that 'twill blow, too."</p>

<p>"Oh, aye," Topsail replied, indifferently,
"snow 'n' blow. We'll know what 'twill do
when it begins," he added. "Billy, b'y!" he
shouted.</p>

<p>In response Billy Topsail came bounding down
the rocky path from the cottage. He was stout
for his age, with broad shoulders, long thick arms
and large hands. There was a boy's flush of expectation
on his face, and the flash of a boy's delight
in his eyes. He was willing for adventure.</p>

<p>"Bill an' me'll take the rodney," Topsail
drawled. "I s'pose you might's well fetch the
punt, an' we'll send you back with the first
haul."</p>

<p>"Hooray!" cried Billy; and with that he
waved his cap and sped back up the hill.</p>

<p>"Fetch your gaff, lad!" Topsail called after
him. "Make haste! There's Joshua Rideout
with his sail up. 'Tis time we was off."</p>

<p>"Looks more'n ever like snow," Bill Watt observed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
while they waited. "I'm thinkin' <em>'twill</em>
snow."</p>

<p>"Oh, maybe 'twon't," said Topsail, optimistic
in a lazy way.</p>

<p>The ice-floe was two miles or more off the
coast; thence it stretched to the horizon&mdash;a vast,
rough, blinding white field, formed of detached
fragments. Some of the "pans" were acres in
size; others were not big enough to bear the
weight of a man; all were floating free, rising
and falling with the ground swell.</p>

<p>The wind was light, the sea quiet, the sky
thinly overcast. Had it not been for the threat
of heavy weather in the northeast, it would have
been an ideal day for the hunt. The punt and
the rodney, the latter far in the lead, ran quietly
out from the harbour, with their little sails all
spread. From the punt Billy Topsail could soon
see the small, scattered pack of seals&mdash;black dots
against the white of the ice.</p>

<p>When the rodney made the field, the punts of
the harbour fleet had disappeared in the winding
lanes of open water that led through the floe.
Tom Topsail was late. The nearer seals were
all marked by the hunters who had already
landed. The rodney would have to be taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
farther in than the most venturesome hunter had
yet dared to go&mdash;perilously far into the midst of
the shifting pans.</p>

<p>The risk of sudden wind&mdash;the risk that the
heavy fragments would "pack" and "nip"
the boat&mdash;had to be taken if seals were to be
killed.</p>

<p>"We got to go right in, Bill," said Topsail, as
he furled the rodney's sails.</p>

<p>"I s'pose," was Watt's reply, with a backward
glance to the northeast. "An' Billy?"</p>

<p>"'Tis not wise to take un in," Topsail answered,
hastily. "We'll have un bide here."</p>

<p>Billy was hailed, and, to his great disappointment,
warned to keep beyond the edge of the
floe. Then the rodney shot into the lane, with
Topsail and Bill Watt rowing like mad. She
was soon lost to sight. Billy shipped his sail
and paddled to the edge of the ice, to wait, as
patiently as might be, for the reappearance of
the rodney.</p>

<p>Patience soon gave way to impatience, impatience
to anxiety, anxiety to great fear for the
lives of his father and the mate, for the offshore
gale was driving up; the blue-black clouds were
already high and rising swiftly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>At last there came an ominous puff of wind.
It swept over the sea from the coast, whipping
up little waves in its course&mdash;frothy little waves,
that hissed. Heavy flakes of snow began to fall.
As the wind rose they fell faster, and came driving,
swirling with it.</p>

<p>With the fall of the first flakes the harbour
fleet came pell-mell from the floe. Not a man
among them but wished himself in a sheltered
place. Sails were raised in haste, warnings were
shouted; then off went the boats, beating up to
harbour with all sail set.</p>

<p>"Make sail, lad!" old Elisha Bull shouted to
Billy, as his punt swung past.</p>

<p>Billy shook his head. "I'll beat back with
father!" he cried.</p>

<p>"You'll lose yourself!" Elisha screamed, as a
last warning, before his punt carried him out of
hail.</p>

<p>But Billy still hung at the edge of the ice.
His father had said, "Bide here till we come
out," and "bide" there he would.</p>

<p>He kept watch for the rodney, but no rodney
came. Minute after minute flew by. He hesitated.
Was it not his duty to beat home? There
was still the fair chance that he might be able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
make the harbour. Did he not owe a duty to
his mother&mdash;to himself?</p>

<p>But a crashing noise from the floe brought
him instantly to a decision. He knew what that
noise meant. The ice was feeling the force of
the wind. It would pack and move out to sea.
The lane by which the rodney had entered then
slowly closed.</p>

<p>In horror Billy watched the great pans swing
together. There was now no escape for the
boat. The strong probability was that she
would be crushed to splinters by the crowding
of the ice; that indeed she had already been
crushed; that the men were either drowned or
cast away on the floe.</p>

<p>At once the lad's duty was plain to him. He
must stay where he was. If his father and Bill
Watt managed to get to the edge of the ice
afoot, who else was to take them off?</p>

<p>The ice was moving out to sea, Billy knew.
The pans were crunching, grinding, ever more
noisily. But he let the punt drift as near as he
dared, and so followed the pack towards the
open, keeping watch, ever more hopelessly, for
the black forms of the two men.</p>

<p>Soon, so fast did the sea rise, so wild was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
wind, his own danger was very great. The ice
was like a rocky shore to leeward. He began to
fear that he would be wrecked.</p>

<p>Time and again the punt was nearly swamped,
but Billy dared not drop the oars to bail. There
was something more. His arms, stout and seasoned
though they were, were giving out. It
would not long be possible to keep the boat off
the ice. He determined to land on the floe.</p>

<p>But the sea was breaking on the ice dead to
leeward. It was impossible to make a landing
there, so with great caution he paddled to the
right, seeking a projecting point, behind which
he might find shelter. At last he came to a
cove. It narrowed to a long, winding arm,
which apparently extended some distance into
the floe.</p>

<p>There he found quiet water. He landed without
difficulty at a point where the arm was no
more than a few yards wide. Dusk was then
approaching. The wind was bitterly cold, and
the snow was thick and blinding.</p>

<p>It would not be safe, he knew, to leave the
boat in the water, for at any moment the shifting
pans might close and crush it. He tried to lift
it out of the water, but his strength was not sufficient.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
He managed to get the bow on the ice;
that was all.</p>

<p>"I'll just have to leave it," he thought. "I'll
just have to trust that 'twill not be nipped."</p>

<p>Near by there was a hummock of ice. He
sought the lee of it, and there, protected from the
wind, he sat down to wait.</p>

<p>Often, when the men were spinning yarns in
the cottages of Ruddy Cove of a winter night,
he had listened, open-mouthed, to the tales of
seal-hunters who had been cast away. Now he
was himself drifting out to sea. He had no fire,
no food, no shelter but a hummock of ice. He
had the bitterness of the night to pass through&mdash;the
hunger of to-morrow to face.</p>

<p>"But sure," he muttered, with characteristic
hopefulness, "I've a boat, an' many a man has
been cast away without one."</p>

<p>He thought he had better make another effort
to haul the boat on the ice. Some movement of
the pack might close the arm where it floated.
So he stumbled towards the place.</p>

<p>He stared round in amazement and alarm;
then he uttered a cry of terror. The open water
had disappeared.</p>

<p>"She's been nipped!" he sobbed. "She's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
been nipped&mdash;nipped to splinters! I've lost meself!"</p>

<p>Night came fast. An hour before, so dense
was the storm, nothing had been visible sixty
paces away; now nothing was to be seen anywhere.
Where was the rodney? Had his father
and Bill Watt escaped from the floe by some
new opening? Were they safe at home? Were
they still on the floe? He called their names.
The swish of the storm, the cracking and crunching
of the ice as the wind swept it on&mdash;that was
all that he heard.</p>

<p>For a long time he sat in dull despair. He
hoped no longer.</p>

<p>By and by, when it was deep night, something
occurred to distract him. He caught sight of a
crimson glow, flaring and fading. It seemed to
be in the sky, now far off, now near at hand.
He started up.</p>

<p>"What's that?" he muttered.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<div class='summary'><i>In Which Old Tom Topsail Burns His Punt and
Billy Wanders in the Night and Three Lives
Hang on a Change of the Wind</i></div>


<div class='drop-cap'>MEANWHILE, under the powerful
strokes of old Tom Topsail and Bill
Watt, the rodney had followed the
open leads into the heart of the floe. From time
to time Watt muttered a warning; but the spirit
of the hunt fully possessed Tom, and his only
cry was, "Push on! Push on!"</div>

<p>Seal after seal escaped, while the sky darkened.
He was only the more determined not to
go back empty-handed.</p>

<p>"I tells you," Watt objected, "we'll not get
out. There's the wind now. And snow, man&mdash;snow!"</p>

<p>The warning was not to be disregarded. Topsail
thought no more about seals. The storm
was fairly upon them. His only concern was to
escape from the floe. He was glad, indeed, that
Billy had not followed them. He had that, at
least, to be thankful for.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>They turned the boat. Bending to the oars,
they followed the lane by which they had entered.
Confusion came with the wind and the
snow. The lay of the pans seemed to have
changed. It was changing every moment, as
they perceived.</p>

<p>"Tom," gasped Watt, at last, "we're caught!
'Tis a blind lead we're in."</p>

<p>That was true; the lane had closed. They
must seek another exit. So they turned the boat
and followed the next lane that opened. It, too,
was blocked.</p>

<p>They tried another, selected at random. In
that blinding storm no choice was possible.
Again disappointment; the lane narrowed to a
point. They were nearly exhausted now, but
they turned instantly to seek another way. That
way was not to be found. The lane had closed
behind them.</p>

<p>"Trapped!" muttered Watt.</p>

<p>"Aye, lad," Topsail said, solemnly, "trapped!"</p>

<p>They rested on their oars. Ice was on
every hand. They stared into each other's
eyes.</p>

<p>Then, for the second time, Watt ran his glance
over the shores of the lake in which they floated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
He started, then pointed in the direction from
which they had come. Topsail needed no word
of explanation. The ice was closing in. The
pressure of the pack beyond would soon obliterate
the lake. They rowed desperately for the
nearest shore.</p>

<p>The ice was rapidly closing in. In such cases,
as they knew, it often closed with a sudden rush
at the end, crushing some pan which for a moment
had held it in check.</p>

<p>When the boat struck the ice Watt jumped
ashore with the painter. Topsail, leaping from
seat to seat, followed instantly. At that moment
there was a loud crack, like a clap
of thunder. It was followed by a crunching
noise.</p>

<p>"It's comin'!" screamed Topsail.</p>

<p>"Heave away!"</p>

<p>They caught the bow, lifted it out of the water,
and with a united effort slowly hauled it out of
harm's way. A moment later there was no sign
of open water.</p>

<p>"Thank God!" gasped Topsail.</p>

<p>By this time the storm was a blizzard. The
men had no shelter, and they were afraid to venture
far from the boat in search of it. Neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
would permit the other to stumble over the rough
ice, chancing its pitfalls, for neither cared to be
lost from the other.</p>

<p>Now they sat silent in the lee of the upturned
boat, with the snow swirling about them; again
they ran madly back and forth; yet again they
swung their arms and stamped their feet. At
last, do what they would, they shivered all the
time. Then they sat quietly down.</p>

<p>"I'm wonderful glad Billy is safe home," Watt
observed.</p>

<p>"I wisht I was sure o' that," said Topsail.
"It looks bad for us, Bill, lad. The ice is drivin'
out fast, an' I'm thinkin' 'twill blow steady for a
day. It looks wonderful bad for us, an' I'd feel&mdash;easier
in me mind&mdash;about the lad's mother&mdash;if
I knowed he was safe home."</p>

<p>Late in the night Topsail turned to Watt. He
had to nudge him to get his attention. "It's
awful cold, Bill," he said. "We got the boat,
lad. Eh? We got the boat."</p>

<p>"No, no, Tom! Not yet! We'd be sure
doomed without the boat."</p>

<p>Half an hour passed. Again Topsail roused
Watt.</p>

<p>"We're doomed if we don't," he said. "We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
can't stand it till mornin', lad. We can't wait no
longer."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 371px;">
<img src="images/i004.jpg" width="371" height="500" alt="man approaching two men in light" />
<div class="caption">BILLY STAGGERED INTO THE CIRCLE OF LIGHT.</div>
</div>

<p>Watt blundered to his feet. Without a word
he fumbled in the snow until he found what he
sought. It was the axe. He handed it to Topsail.</p>

<p>"Do it, Tom!" he said, thickly. "I'm near
gone."</p>

<p>Topsail attacked the boat. It was like murder,
he thought. He struck blow after blow, blindly,
viciously; gathered the splinters, made a little
heap of them and set them afire. The fire blazed
brightly. Soon it was roaring. The ice all
around was lighted up. Above, the snow reflected
the lurid glow.</p>

<p>Warmth and a cheerful light put life in
the men. They crept as close to the fire as they
could. Reason would shut out hope altogether,
but hope came to them. Might not the storm
abate? Might not the wind change? Might not
they be picked up? In this strain they talked
for a long time; and meanwhile they added the
fuel, splinter by splinter.</p>

<p>"Father! 'Tis <em>you!</em>"</p>

<p>Topsail leaped to his feet and stared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Tis Billy!" cried Watt.</p>

<p>Billy staggered into the circle of light. He
stared stupidly at the fire. Then he tottered a
step or two nearer, and stood swaying; and again
he stared at the fire in a stupid way.</p>

<p>"I seed the fire!" he mumbled. "The punt's
nipped, sir&mdash;an' I seed the fire&mdash;an' crawled over
the ice. 'Twas hard to find you."</p>

<p>Tom Topsail and Bill Watt understood. They,
too, had travelled rough ice in a blizzard, and
they understood.</p>

<p>Billy was wet to the waist. That meant that,
blinded by the snow or deceived by the night, he
had slipped through some opening in the ice,
some crack or hole. The bare thought of that
lonely peril was enough to make the older men
shudder. But they asked him no questions.
They led him to the fire, prodigally replenished
it, and sat him down between them. By and by
he was so far recovered that he was able to support
his father's argument that the wind had not
changed.</p>

<p>"Oh, well," replied Watt, doggedly, "you can
say what you likes; but I tells you that the
wind's veered to the south. 'Twould not surprise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
me if the pack was drivin' Cape Wonder
way."</p>

<p>"No, no, Bill," said Topsail sadly; "there's
been no change. We're drivin' straight out.
When the wind drops the pack'll go to pieces,
an' then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Thus the argument was continued, intermittently,
until near dawn. Of a sudden, then, they
heard a low, far-off rumble. It was a significant,
terrifying noise. It ran towards them, increasing
in volume. It was like the bumping that runs
through a freight-train when the engine comes to
a sudden stop.</p>

<p>The pack trembled. There was then a fearful
confusion of grinding, crashing sounds. Everywhere
the ice was heaving and turning. The
smaller pans were crushed; many of the greater
ones were forced on end; some were lifted
bodily out of the water, and fell back in fragments,
broken by their own weight. On all
sides were noise and awful upheaval. The great
pan upon which the seal-hunters had landed was
tipped up&mdash;up&mdash;up&mdash;until it was like the side of
a steep hill. There it rested. Then came
silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>Bill Watt was right: the wind had changed;
the pack had grounded on Cape Wonder. The
three men from Ruddy Cove walked ashore in
the morning.</p>

<p>Billy was the first to run up to the house. He
went through the door like a gale of wind.</p>

<p>"We're safe, mother!" he shouted.</p>

<p>"I'm glad, dear," said his mother, quietly.
"Breakfast is ready."</p>

<p>When Billy was older he learned the trick his
mother had long ago mastered&mdash;to betray no excitement,
whatever the situation.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<div class='summary'><i>How Billy Topsail's Friend Bobby Lot Joined
Fortunes With Eli Zitt and Whether or Not he
Proved Worthy of the Partnership</i></div>


<div class='drop-cap'>RUDDY COVE called Eli Zitt a "hard"
man. In Newfoundland, that means
"hardy"&mdash;not "bad." Eli was gruff-voiced,
lowering-eyed, unkempt, big; he could
swim with the dogs, outdare all the reckless
spirits of the Cove with the punt in a gale, bare
his broad breast to the winter winds, travel the
ice wet or dry, shoulder a barrel of flour; he was
a sturdy, fearless giant, was Eli Zitt, of Ruddy
Cove. And for this the Cove very properly
called him a "hard" man.</div>

<p>When Josiah Lot, his partner, put out to sea
and never came back&mdash;an offshore gale had the
guilt of that deed&mdash;Eli scowled more than ever
and said a deal less.</p>

<p>"He'll be feelin' bad about Josiah," said the
Cove.</p>

<p>Which may have been true. However, Eli
took care of Josiah's widow and son. The son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
was Bobby Lot, with whom, subsequently, Billy
Topsail shared the adventure of the giant squid
of Chain Tickle. The Cove laughed with delight
to observe Eli Zitt's attachment to the lad.
The big fellow seemed to be quite unable to pass
the child without patting him on the back; and
sometimes, so exuberant was his affection, the
pats were of such a character that Bobby lost his
breath. Whereupon, Eli would chuckle the
harder, mutter odd endearments, and stride off
on his way.</p>

<p>"He'll be likin' that lad pretty well," said the
Cove. "Nar a doubt, they'll be partners."</p>

<p>And it came to pass as the Cove surmised; but
much sooner than the Cove expected. Josiah
Lot's widow died when Bobby was eleven years
old. When the little gathering at the graveyard
in the shelter of Great Hill dispersed, Eli took
the lad out in the punt&mdash;far out to the quiet fishing
grounds, where they could be alone. It was
a glowing evening&mdash;red and gold in the western
sky. The sea was heaving gently, and the face
of the waters was unruffled.</p>

<p>"Bobby, b'y!" Eli whispered. "Bobby, lad!
Does you hear me? Don't cry no more!"</p>

<p>"Ay, Eli," sobbed Bobby. "I'll cry no more."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>But he kept on crying, just the same, for he
could not stop; and Eli looked away&mdash;very
quickly&mdash;to the glowing sunset clouds. Can't
<em>you</em> tell why?</p>

<p>"Bobby," he said, turning, at last, to the lad,
"us'll be partners&mdash;you an' me."</p>

<p>Bobby sobbed harder than ever.</p>

<p>"Won't us, lad?"</p>

<p>Eli laid his great hand on Bobby's shoulder.
Then Bobby took his fists out of his eyes and
looked up into Eli's compassionate face.</p>

<p>"Ay, Eli," he said, "us'll be partners&mdash;jus'
you an' me."</p>

<p>From that out, they <em>were</em> partners; and Bobby
Lot was known in the Cove as the foster son of
Eli Zitt. They lived together in Eli's cottage by
the tickle cove, where Eli had lived alone, since,
many years before, <em>his</em> mother had left <em>him</em> to
face the world for himself. The salmon net, the
herring seine, the punt, the flake, the stage&mdash;these
they held in common; and they went to
the grounds together, where they fished the long
days through, good friends, good partners. The
Cove said that they were very happy; and, as always,
the Cove was right.</p>

<p>One night Eli came ashore from a trading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
schooner that had put in in the morning, smiling
broadly as he entered the kitchen. He laid his
hand on the table, palm down.</p>

<p>"They's a gift for you under that paw, lad,"
he said.</p>

<p>"For me, Eli!" cried Bobby.</p>

<p>"Ay, lad&mdash;for my partner!"</p>

<p>Bobby stared curiously at the big hand. He
wondered what it covered. "What is it, Eli?"
he asked. "Come, show me!"</p>

<p>Eli lifted the hand, and gazed at Bobby, grinning,
the while, with delight. It was a jack-knife&mdash;a
stout knife, three-bladed, horn-handled,
big, serviceable; just the knife for a fisher lad.
Bobby picked it up, but said never a word, for
his delight overcame him.</p>

<p>"You're wonderful good t' me, Eli," he said,
at last looking up with glistening eyes. "You're
<em>wonderful</em> good t' me!"</p>

<p>Eli put his arm around the boy. "You're a
good partner, lad," he said. "You're a wonderful
good partner!"</p>

<p>Bobby was proud of that.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>They put the salmon net out in the spring.
The ice was still lingering offshore. The west<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
wind carried it out; the east wind swept it in:
variable winds kept pans and bergs drifting
hither and thither, and no man could tell where
next the ice would go. Now, the sea was clear,
from the shore to the jagged, glistening white
line, off near the horizon; next day&mdash;the day
after&mdash;and the pack was grinding against the
coast rocks. Men had to keep watch to save the
nets from destruction.</p>

<p>The partners' net was moored off Break-heart
Point. It was a good berth, but a rough one;
when the wind was in the northeast, the waters
off the point were choppy and covered with
sheets of foam from the breakers.</p>

<p>"'Tis too rough t' haul the salmon net," said
Eli, one day. "I'll be goin' over the hills for a
sack o' flour. An' you'll be a good b'y 'til I
gets back?"</p>

<p>"Oh, ay, sir!" said Bobby Lot.</p>

<p>It was a rough day: the wind was blowing
from the north, a freshening, gusty breeze, cold
and misty; off to sea, the sky was leaden, threatening,
and overhead dark clouds were driving
low and swift with the wind; the water was
choppy&mdash;rippling black under the squalls. The
ice was drifting alongshore, well out from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
coast; there was a berg and the wreck of a berg
of Arctic ice and many a pan from the bays and
harbours of the coast.</p>

<p>With the wind continuing in the north, the ice
would drift harmlessly past. But the wind
changed. In the afternoon it freshened and
veered to the east. At four o'clock it was half a
gale, blowing inshore.</p>

<p>"I'll just be goin' out the tickle t' have a look
at that ice," thought Bobby. "'Tis like it'll
come ashore."</p>

<p>He looked the punt over very carefully before
setting out. It was wise, he thought, to prepare
to take her out into the gale, whether or not he
must go. He saw to it that the thole-pins were
tight and strong, that the bail-bucket was in its
place, that the running gear was fit for heavy
strain. The wind was then fluttering the harbour
water and screaming on the hilltops; and he
could hear the sea breaking on the tickle rocks.
He rowed down the harbour to the mouth of the
tickle, whence he commanded a view of the coast,
north and south.</p>

<p>The ice was drifting towards Break-heart
Point. It would destroy the salmon net within
the hour, he perceived&mdash;sweep over it, tear it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
from its moorings, bruise it against the rocks.
Bobby knew, in a moment, that his duty was to
put out from the sheltered harbour to the wind-swept,
breaking open, where the spume was flying
and the heave and fret of the sea threatened
destruction to the little punt. Were he true man
and good partner he would save the net!</p>

<p>"He've been good t' me," he thought.
"Ay, Eli 've been wonderful good t' me. I'll
be true partner t' him!"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<div class='summary'><i>Bobby Lot Learns to Swim and Eli Zitt Shows
Amazing Courage and Self-possession and
Strength</i></div>


<div class='drop-cap'>WHEN, returning over the hills, Eli Zitt
came to the Knob o' Break-heart, he
saw his own punt staggering through
the gray waves towards the net off the point&mdash;tossing
with the sea and reeling under the gusty
wind&mdash;with his little partner in the stern. The
boat was between the ice and the breakers. The
space of open water was fast narrowing; only a
few minutes more and the ice would strike the
rocks. Eli dropped on his knees, then and there,
and prayed God to save the lad.</div>

<p>"O Lard, save my lad!" he cried. "O Lard,
save my wee lad!"</p>

<p>He saw the punt draw near the first mooring;
saw Bobby loose the sheet, and let the brown sail
flutter like a flag in the wind; saw him leap to
the bow, and lean over, with a knife in his hand,
while the boat tossed in the lop, shipping water
every moment; saw him stagger amidships, bail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
like mad, snatch up the oars, pull to the second
mooring and cut the last net-rope; saw him leap
from seat to seat to the stem, grasp the tiller,
haul taut the sheet, and stand off to the open
sea.</p>

<p>"Clever Bobby!" he screamed, wildly excited.
"Clever lad! My partner, my little partner!"</p>

<p>But the wind carried the cry away. Bobby
did not hear&mdash;did not know, even, that his partner
had been a spectator of his brave faithfulness.
He was beating out, to make sea-room
for the run with the wind to harbour; and the
boat was dipping her gunwale in a way that
kept every faculty alert to keep her afloat. Eli
watched him until he rounded and stood in for
the tickle. Then the man sighed happily and
went home.</p>

<p>"Us'll grapple for that net the morrow," he
said, when Bobby came in.</p>

<p>Bobby opened his eyes. "Aye?" he said.
"'Tis safe on the bottom. I thought I'd best cut
it adrift t' save it."</p>

<p>"I seed you," said Eli, "from the Knob. 'Twas
well done, lad! You're a true partner."</p>

<p>"The knife come in handy," said Bobby, smiling.
"'Tis a good knife."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>"Aye," said Eli, with a shake of the head. "I
bought un for a good one."</p>

<p>And that was all.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Eli set about rearing young Bobby in a fashion
as wise as he knew. He exposed the lad to wet
and weather, as judiciously as he could, to make
him hardy; he took him to sea in high winds, to
fix his courage and teach him to sail; he taught
him the weather signs, the fish-lore of the coast,
the "marks" for the fishing grounds, the whereabouts
of shallows and reefs and currents; he
took him to church and sent him to Sunday-school.
And he taught him to swim.</p>

<p>On the fine days of that summer, when there
were no fish to be caught, the man and the lad
went together to the Wash-tub&mdash;a deep, little
cove of the sea, clear, quiet, bottomed with smooth
rock and sheltered from the wind by high cliffs;
but cold&mdash;almost as cold as ice-water. Here
Bobby delighted to watch Eli dive, leap from the
cliff, float on his back, swim far out to sea; here
he gazed with admiration on the man's rugged
body&mdash;broad shoulders, bulging muscles, great
arms and legs. And here, too, he learned to
swim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>When the warmest summer days were gone,
Bobby could paddle about the Wash-tub in
promising fashion. He was confident when Eli
was at hand&mdash;sure, then, that he could keep
afloat. But he was not yet sure enough of his
power when Eli had gone on the long swim to
sea. Eli said that he had done well; and Bobby,
himself, often said that he could swim a deal better
than a stone. In an emergency, both agreed,
Bobby's new accomplishment would be sure to
serve him well.</p>

<p>"Sure, if the punt turned over," Bobby innocently
boasted, "I'd be able t' swim 'til you
righted her."</p>

<p>That was to be proved.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Eli, b'y," said old James Blunt, one day in
the fall of the year, "do you take my new dory
t' the grounds t'-day. Sure, I'd like t' know
how you likes it."</p>

<p>Old James had built his boat after a south-coast
model. She was a dory, a flat-bottomed
craft, as distinguished from a punt, which has a
round bottom and keel. He was proud of her,
but somewhat timid; and he wanted Eli's opinion
of her quality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Tis a queer lookin' thing!" said Eli. "But
me an' my partner'll try she, James, just for
luck."</p>

<p>That afternoon a fall gale caught the dory on
the Farthest Grounds&mdash;far out beyond the Wolf's
Teeth Reef. It came from the shore so suddenly
that Eli could not escape it. So it was a beat to
harbour, with the wind and sea rising fast. Off
the Valley, which is half a mile from the narrows,
a gust came out between the hills&mdash;came strong
and swift. It heeled the dory over&mdash;still over&mdash;down&mdash;down
until the water poured in over the
gunwale. Eli let go the main-sheet, expecting
the sail to fall away from the wind and thus ease
the boat. But the line caught in the block.
Down went the dory&mdash;still down. And of a sudden
it capsized.</p>

<p>When Bobby came to the surface, he began
frantically to splash the water, momentarily losing
strength, breath and self-possession. Eli was
waiting for him, with head and shoulders out of
the water, like an eager dog as he waits for the
stick his master is about to throw. He swam
close; but hung off for a moment&mdash;until, indeed,
he perceived that Bobby would never of himself
regain his self-possession&mdash;for he did not want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the boy to be too soon beholden to him for aid.
Then he slipped his hand under Bobby's breast
and buoyed him up.</p>

<p>"Partner!" he said, quietly. "Partner!"</p>

<p>Bobby's panic-stricken struggles at once
ceased; for he had been used to giving instant
obedience to Eli's commands. He looked in
Eli's dripping face.</p>

<p>"Easy, partner," said Eli, still quietly.
"Strike out, now."</p>

<p>Bobby smiled, and struck out, as directed. In
a moment he was swimming at Eli's side.</p>

<p>"Take it easy, lad," Eli continued. "Just
take it easy while I rights the boat. It's all
right. I'll have you aboard in a jiffy. Is you&mdash;is
you&mdash;all right, Bobby?"</p>

<p>"Aye," Bobby gasped.</p>

<p>Eli waited for a moment longer. He was
loath to leave the boy to take care of himself.
Until then he had not known how large a place
in his heart his little partner filled, how much he
had come to depend upon him for all those
things which make life worth while. He had not
known, indeed, how far away from the old, lonely
life the lad had led him. So he waited for a
moment longer, watching Bobby. Then he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
swam to the overturned dory, where, after an
anxious glance towards the lad, he dived to cut
away the gear&mdash;and dived again, and yet again;
watching Bobby all the time he was at the surface
for breath.</p>

<p>The gear cut away, the mast pulled from its
socket, Eli righted the boat. It takes a strong
man and clever swimmer to do that; but Eli was
clever in the water, and strong anywhere. Moreover,
it was a trick he had learned.</p>

<p>"Come, Bobby, b'y!" he called.</p>

<p>Bobby swam towards the boat. Eli swam to
meet him, and helped him over the last few
yards of choppy sea, for the lad was almost exhausted.
Bobby laid a hand on the bow of the
dory. Then Eli pulled off one of his long boots,
and swam to the stern, where he began cautiously
to bail the boat. When she was light
enough in the water, he helped Bobby aboard,
and Bobby bailed her dry.</p>

<p>"Ha, lad!" Eli ejaculated, with a grin that
made his face shine. "You is safe aboard.
How is you, b'y?"</p>

<p>"Tired, Eli," Bobby answered.</p>

<p>"You bide quiet where you is," said Eli. "I'll
find the paddles; an' I'll soon have you home."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>Eli's great concern had been to get the boy
out of the water. He had cared for little else
than that&mdash;to get him out of the reach of the sea.
And now he was confronted by the problem of
making harbour. The boat was slowly drifting
out with the wind; the dusk was approaching;
and every moment it was growing more difficult
to swim in the choppy sea. It took him a long
time to find the paddles.</p>

<p>"Steady the boat, Bobby," he said, when the
boy had taken the paddles into the dory. "I'm
comin' aboard."</p>

<p>Eli attempted to board the dory over the bow.
She was tossing about in a choppy sea; and he
was not used to her ways. Had she been a punt&mdash;his
punt&mdash;he would have been aboard in a
trice. But she was not his punt&mdash;not a punt, at
all; she was a new boat, a dory, a flat-bottomed
craft; he was not used to her ways. Bobby tried
desperately to steady her while Eli lifted himself
out of the water.</p>

<p>"Take care, Eli!" he screamed. "She'll be
over!"</p>

<p>Eli got his knee on the gunwale&mdash;no more
than that. A wave tipped the boat; she lurched;
she capsized. And again Eli waited for Bobby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
to come to the surface of the water; again buoyed
him up; again gave him courage; again helped
him to the boat; again bailed the boat&mdash;this
time with one of Bobby's boots&mdash;and again
helped Bobby aboard.</p>

<p>"I'm wonderful tired, Eli," said Bobby, when
the paddles were handed over the side for the
second time. "I'm fair' done out."</p>

<p>"'Twill be over soon, lad. I'll have you home
by the kitchen fire in half an hour. Come, now,
partner! Steady the boat. I'll try again."</p>

<p>Even more cautiously Eli attempted to clamber
aboard. Inch by inch he raised himself out
of the water. When the greater waves ran under
the boat, he paused; when she rode on an even
keel, he came faster. Inch by inch, humouring
the cranky boat all the time, he lifted his right
leg. But he could not get aboard. Again,
when his knee was on the gunwale, the dory
capsized.</p>

<p>For the third time the little partner was helped
aboard and given a boot with which to bail.
His strength was then near gone. He threw
water over the side until he could no longer lift
his arms.</p>

<p>"Eli," he gasped, "I can do no more!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>Eli put his hand on the bow, as though about
to attempt to clamber aboard again. But he
withdrew it.</p>

<p>"Bobby, b'y," he said, "could you not manage
t' pull a bit with the paddles. I'll swim
alongside."</p>

<p>Bobby stared stupidly at him.</p>

<p>Again Eli put his hand on the bow. He was
in terror of losing Bobby's life. Never before
had he known such dread and fear. He did not
dare risk overturning the boat again; for he
knew that Bobby would not survive for the fourth
time. What could he do? He could not get
aboard, and Bobby could not row. How was he
to get the boy ashore? His hand touched the
painter&mdash;the long rope by which the boat was
moored to the stage. That gave him an idea:
he would tow the boat ashore!</p>

<p>So he took the rope in his teeth, and struck
out for the tickle to the harbour!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"'Twas a close call, b'y," said Eli, when he
and Bobby sat by the kitchen fire.</p>

<p>"Ay, Eli; 'twas a close call."</p>

<p>"A <em>wonderful</em> close call!" Eli repeated, grinning.
"The closest I ever knowed."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>"An' 'twas too bad," said Bobby, "t' lose the
gear."</p>

<p>Eli laughed.</p>

<p>"What you laughin' at?" Bobby asked.</p>

<p>"I brought ashore something better than the
gear."</p>

<p>"The dory?"</p>

<p>"No, b'y!" Eli roared. "My little partner!"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<div class='summary'><i>Containing the Surprising Adventure of Eli Zitt's
Little Partner on the Way Back from Fortune
Harbour, in Which a Newfoundland Dog Displays
a Saving Intelligence</i></div>


<div class='drop-cap'>BOBBY LOT, Eli Zitt's little partner, left
his dog at home when he set out for Fortune
Harbour in Eli's punt. He thought
it better for the dog. He liked company, well
enough, did Bobby; but he loved his dog. Why
expose the lazy, fat, old fellow, with his shaky
legs and broken teeth, to an attack in force by
the pack of a strange harbour?</div>

<p>The old dog's fighting days were over. He
had been a mighty, masterful beast in his prime;
and he had scarred too many generations of the
Ruddy Cove pack to be molested now as he
waddled about the roads and coves where his
strength and courage had been proved. But
the dogs of Fortune Harbour knew nothing of
the deeds he had done; and an air of dignity, a
snarl and a show of yellow teeth would not be
sufficient to discourage the yelping onset.</p>

<p>"They'd kill him," thought the master.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>So the lad determined to leave his dog at
home, and it was well for him that he did.</p>

<p>"Go back, Bruce!" he cried, as he pushed
out from Eli Zitt's wharf-head.</p>

<p>But Bruce slipped into the water from the
rocks, and swam after the boat, a beseeching
look in the eyes which age had glazed and shot
with blood. He was not used to being left at
home when Bobby pushed out in the punt.</p>

<p>"Go home, b'y!" cried Bobby, lifting an oar.</p>

<p>The threatening gesture was too much for
Bruce. He raised himself in the water and
whined, then wheeled about and paddled for
shore.</p>

<p>"Good dog!" Bobby called after him.</p>

<p>In response, the water in the wake of the dog
was violently agitated. He was wagging his
tail. Thus he signified a cheerful acquiescence.</p>

<p>"He'll be wonderin' why he've been sent back,"
thought Bobby. "'Tis too bad we can't tell dogs
things like that."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Bobby had a message for Sammy Tompkins.
It was about the great run of cod at Good Luck
Tickles, the news of which had reached Ruddy
Cove that morning. But old Sammy was on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
Black Fly fishing grounds when the lad got to
Fortune Harbour. It was growing dark when he
got in for the night. So Bobby chanced to be
late starting home.</p>

<p>The wind had fallen away to a breathless
calm; the sky was thickly overcast, and a thin
mist lay between the gloomy clouds and the sea's
long, black ground-swell. Bobby had not pulled
through four of the six miles before sea and sky
and rocky coast were melted into one vast, deep
shadow, except where, near at hand, the bolder
headlands were to be distinguished by one who
knew them well.</p>

<p>"I wonder," Bobby thought, "if I'll get home
before mornin'. 'Tis hard t' say. I might have
t' lie out here all night. Sure, I hope it gets no
thicker."</p>

<p>He rowed on towards Ruddy Cove, taking
new bearings from time to time as the deeper
shadows of the headlands loomed out of the dark
of the night. Thus, he followed the coast, making
with great caution for the narrow entrance to
the inner harbour, which invariably was hard to
find at night or in the fog.</p>

<p>The sea was breaking against the rocks. The
noise was loud in Bobby's ears, and served to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
guide him at such times as the headlands were
indistinguishable from the clouds. His progress
was slow and cautious; for he knew the dangers
of the way he must take.</p>

<p>There was a line of submerged rocks&mdash;The
Wrecker, Old Moll and Deep Down&mdash;lying out
from Iron Head, directly in his path. That
neighbourhood was a neighbourhood of danger.
When the lad caught sight of the strange outline
of Iron Head, he swerved the bow of the boat to
sea and paddled out. He wanted to make sure
of rounding Deep Down, the outermost rock&mdash;of
giving it a wide berth.</p>

<p>But the night and the noise of the breakers
confused him. He could not tell whether or not
he had gone far enough. At length he decided
that he must be safely beyond the rock. But
where was Deep Down? Often he paused to
turn and look ahead. Every glance he cast was
more anxious than the one before. He was getting
nervous.</p>

<p>"'Tis hard t' tell if the sea is breakin' on Deep
Down," he said to himself. "Sure, it must be,
though."</p>

<p>It was important to know that. Sometimes
only the larger swells curl and break as they roll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
over Deep Down. Bobby knew that just such a
sea was running then. Had it been daylight,
the green colour and the slight lifting of the
water would have warned him of the whereabouts
of that dangerous reef. But it was night;
the spray, as the wave was broken and flung into
the air, and the swish and the patter, as the water
fell back, were the signs he was on the lookout
for.</p>

<p>If, then, the waves broke only at long intervals,
the punt might at any moment be lifted and
overturned. It might even then be floating over
the rock. Bobby's heart beat faster when the
greater swells slipped under the boat. Would
they break beneath him? Would they break
near at hand? He paddled slowly. It was better
to be cautious, he thought, until he had Deep
Down located. So he listened and looked as he
paddled on.</p>

<p>At last he heard the significant swish and patter.
He flashed about to look ahead. But he
was too late. The spray had fallen and disappeared.</p>

<p>"'Tis somewheres near," he thought, "and 'tis
breakin'. But whether t' port or starboard, I
don't know."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>Again&mdash;and apparently from another quarter&mdash;he
heard the noise of a breaking wave. He
turned in time to catch sight of a gleam of phosphorescence
off the port bow.</p>

<p>"If that's Deep Down," he thought, "I'm safe.
But if 'tis Old Moll or The Wrecker, I'm somewheres
over Deep Down. I wisht I knowed
which it was."</p>

<p>What was it? The Wrecker, Old Moll or
Deep Down? Which one of the three rocks that
lay in a line off Iron Head?</p>

<p>"I wisht I knowed," Bobby muttered, as he
bent anew to the oars.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the meantime, old Sol Sludge, of Becky
Sharpe's cove, which lies beyond Iron Head, had
started for Ruddy Cove by the goat paths to tell
Skipper John Matthews that he would take a
berth in the schooner <i>Rescue</i> when she got back
from the Labrador.</p>

<p>He had a candle-lantern to light the way.
When he had crossed the Head and was bound
down the valley to meet the Ruddy Cove road,
he heard a cry for help. It came from the sea,
with a soft southwest wind which had sprung up&mdash;a
sharp "Help! Help!" ringing out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
darkness again and again. Old Sol listened
stupidly, until, as from exhaustion, the cries
turned hoarse and weak.</p>

<p>"Now, I wonder who's out there," the dull old
fellow thought. "It sounded like a woman's
voice. Sure, it may be the spirit o' Mary Rutt.
She was drowned off Iron Head."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he made haste to Ruddy
Cove&mdash;all the haste his old legs and dim
sight would permit&mdash;and told the folk that
he had heard the cry of a spirit drift in
from the sea off Iron Head. But nobody believed
that.</p>

<p>Who was in the water off Iron Head? was the
question that passed from cottage to cottage.
Was it Billy Topsail? No; for Billy told the folk
in person that he had come in from the grounds
at twilight. Was it Josiah Seaworthy? No; for
Josiah's wife said that he had gone by way of
Crooked Tickle to Burnt Harbour.</p>

<p>Who was it? Had Eli Zitt's little partner
got back from Fortune Harbour? When Eli
Zitt heard of that cry for help he knew that Bobby's
punt had been overturned on one of the
Iron Head rocks. Like a woman's voice? That
surely was Bobby's&mdash;that clear, full voice. So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
he called for a crew to man the skiff, and in five
minutes he was ready to push off.</p>

<p>Old Bruce jumped aboard.</p>

<p>"Get out with you!" said Bill Watt, aiming a
kick at him by the light of the lantern.</p>

<p>"Sc-ctt!" cried old Tom Topsail.</p>

<p>But Bruce was a practiced stowaway. He slunk
forward, and found a refuge under the bow seat.</p>

<p>"Push off, lads!" Eli shouted. "Give way!"</p>

<p>In ten minutes the skiff had passed from the
harbour to the sea. Eli Zitt, who worked the
scull oar, turned her bow towards the Iron Head
rocks. It was dark; but he had fished those
waters from boyhood, and he knew the way, daylight
or dark.</p>

<p>Dark it was, indeed! How was Bobby to be
found in that great shadow? He was a water-dog,
was Bobby; but there was a limit to his endurance,
and half an hour at least had passed
since old Sol Sludge had heard his cry for help.</p>

<p>A long search meant failure. He must be
found soon or he would not be found at all. On
went the boat, the water curling from her bows
and swirling in her wake. The phosphorescence
flashed and glowed as the oars were struck deep
and lifted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>"He'll be swimmin' in," Bill Watt panted,
when the skiff had covered half the distance to
Deep Down. "They's no place for him t' land
with this sea on. We ought t' meet him hereabouts."</p>

<p>"If he's afloat," Topsail added.</p>

<p>"Oh, he's afloat yet," Eli said, confidently.
"He's a strong swimmer, that lad is."</p>

<p>"I'm thinkin' he'll be nearer shore," said Bill
Watt.</p>

<p>"No, no! He's further out an' on."</p>

<p>"Bobby!" Topsail shouted. "Oh, Bobby!"</p>

<p>There was no reply. For a moment the rowers
lifted their oars from the water. Silence was
all about&mdash;from the boat to the shore rocks,
where the waves were breaking. The cries for
help had ceased.</p>

<p>"Gone down," Bill Watt muttered.</p>

<p>The men gave way again. Again they paused
to call Bobby's name, and to listen, with anxious
hearts, for some far-off, answering cry. Again
they gave way. Again they called and called,
but heard no answer.</p>

<p>"Gone down," Bill Watt repeated.</p>

<p>"Give way, lads!" cried Eli. "He's further
out."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>Old Bruce came out from hiding. He crawled
to the stern seat and sniffed to windward. Then,
with his nose pointed astern, he began to howl.</p>

<p>"Shut up, you!" Topsail exclaimed.</p>

<p>But Bruce could not be quieted&mdash;not even after
Topsail's boot had caught him in the side and
brought a sharp howl of pain. Still he sniffed to
windward and barked.</p>

<p>"Throw him over," said Bill Watt. "We'll
not be able t' hear Bobby."</p>

<p>"Oh, if 'twas only light!" Eli groaned, not
heeding Watt.</p>

<p>But it was dark. The water was covered with
deepest shadow. Only the breakers and the
black outline of Iron Head could be seen. Bobby
might be swimming near at hand but too far off
to send an audible shout for help.</p>

<p>"Bobby&mdash;oh&mdash;Bobby!"</p>

<p>If a cry in answer had gone up, the barking of
the dog drowned it. The dog must be quieted.</p>

<p>"Push the brute over!" said Watt.</p>

<p>Watt himself dropped his oar and stepped to
the stern. He took Bruce unaware and tumbled
him into the water. The old dog made no protest.
He whined eagerly and swam out from the
boat&mdash;a straight course astern.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, what did he do that for?" mused
Watt.</p>

<p>"That's queer," said Topsail.</p>

<p>Eli looked deep into the night. The dog left
a luminous wake. Beyond, in the direction the
dog had taken, the man caught sight of a phosphorescent
glow. Watt saw it at the same moment.</p>

<p>"What's that?" said he. "They's fiery water,
back there!"</p>

<p>"Man," cried Eli, "the dog knowed! Sure,
it must be Bobby, swimmin' up, an' too beat out
t' cry. Fetch her about, lads. We're on the
wrong course. Haste! He'll not be able t' last
much longer."</p>

<p>Eli was right. The dog <em>had</em> known. It was
Bobby. When they picked him up he was too
much exhausted to speak. It was afterwards
learned that he had mistaken the spray of the
Old Moll breaker for Deep Down and had been
turned over by the outer rock when he thought
himself safe. He had heard the call of his name,
and had seen the lantern of the rescuing skiff, as
it drew near; but, long before, he had worn his
voice out with screaming for help, and could
make no answer. He had heard the barking of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Bruce, too; had known its significance, and had
wondered whether or not the dog would be understood.
But all that he could say, when they
lifted him aboard&mdash;and that in a hoarse, weak
whisper&mdash;was:</p>

<p>"Bruce!"</p>

<p>At that moment the crew heard a piteous whine
near at hand. It was Bill Watt who pulled the
exhausted old dog over the gunwale.</p>

<p>"Good dog!" said he.</p>

<p>And so said they all.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<div class='summary'><i>In Which Billy Topsail Sets Sail for the Labrador,
the Rescue Strikes an Iceberg, and Billy is
Commanded to Pump for His Life</i></div>


<div class='drop-cap'>IT was early in the spring&mdash;a time of changeable
weather when, in the northern seas, the
peril of drift-ice, bergs, snow, wind and the
dark must sometimes be met with short warning.
The schooner <i>Rescue</i>, seventy tons, Job Small,
master, had supplied the half-starved Labrador
fishermen with flour and pork, and was bound
back to Ruddy Cove, in ballast, to load provisions
and shop goods for the straits trade.</div>

<p>Billy Topsail was aboard. "I 'low, dad," he
had said to his father, when the skipper of the
<i>Rescue</i> received the Government commission
to proceed North with supplies, "that I'd like t'
<em>see</em> the Labrador."</p>

<p>"You'll see it many a time, lad," his father had
replied, "afore you're done with it."</p>

<p>"An' Skipper Job," Billy had persisted, "says
he'll take me."</p>

<p>The end of it was that Billy was shipped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Rescue</i> had rounded the cape at dawn,
with all sails set, even to her topmast-staysail,
which the Newfoundlanders call the "Tommy
Dancer"; but now, with the night coming down,
she was laboriously beating into a head wind
under jib and reefed mainsail.</p>

<p>"I'm fair ashamed t' have the canvas off her,"
said Skipper Job, after a long look to windward.
"'Tis no more than a switch, an' we're clewed
up for a snorter."</p>

<p>"They's no one t' see, sir," said the cook.
"That's good; an' sure I hopes that nothin'
heaves in sight t' shame us."</p>

<p>"Leave us shake the reef out o' the mains'l,
sir, an' give her the fores'l," said the first hand.</p>

<p>"We're not in haste, b'y," the skipper replied.
"She's doin' well as she is. We'll not make
harbour this night, an' I've no mind t' be in the
neighbourhood o' the Break-heart Rocks afore
mornin'. Let her bide."</p>

<p>The weather thickened. With the night came
a storm of snow in heavy flakes, which the wind
swept over the deck in clouds. There was nothing
to relieve the inky darkness. The schooner
reeled forth and back on the port and starboard
tacks, beating her way south as blind as a bat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
There was no rest for the crew. The skipper
was at the wheel, the first hand on the lookout
forward, the cook and the two other hands
standing by on deck for emergencies.</p>

<p>So far as the wind, the sea and the drift-ice
were concerned, the danger was slight, for the
<i>Rescue</i> was stoutly built; but the sea was strewn
with vast fields and mountains of Arctic ice,&mdash;the
glacier icebergs which drift out of the north
in the spring&mdash;and in their proximity, in their
great mass and changing position, lay a dreadful
danger.</p>

<p>"Sure, I wisht you could chart icebergs," said
the skipper to the cook. "But," he added,
anxiously, "you can't. They moves so fast an'
so peculiar that&mdash;that&mdash;well, I wisht they didn't."</p>

<p>"I wisht they wasn't none," said the cook.</p>

<p>"Ay, lad," said the skipper. "But they might
be a wonderful big one sixty fathom dead
ahead at this minute. We couldn't see it if they
was."</p>

<p>"I hopes they isn't, sir," said the cook, with a
shiver.</p>

<p>The snow ceased before morning; but at the
peep of dawn a thick fog came up with the wind,
and when the light came it added nothing to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
range of vision from the bow. The night had
been black; the dawn was gray. It was so thick
that the man at the wheel could not see beyond
the foremast. The lookout was lost in the fog
ahead. Eyes were now of no more use than in
the depths of a cloudy night.</p>

<p>But the schooner had weathered the night;
and when the first light of day broke in the east,
Skipper Job gave the wheel to the second hand,
and went below with the cook to have a cup of
tea.</p>

<p>"I've no mind t' lose her," said he, "so I'll
leave her bowl along under short sail. If we
strike, 'twill be so much the easier."</p>

<p>"'Twould be a sad pity t' lose her," said the
cook, "when you've got her so near paid for."</p>

<p>"Ay, that's it," said the skipper.</p>

<p>The <i>Rescue</i> had been built for young Skipper
Job, after Skipper Job's own model, by the
Ruddy Cove trader. The trader was to share in
the voyages&mdash;whether for Labrador fish or in
the Shore trade&mdash;until she was paid for. Then
she would belong to Skipper Job&mdash;to the young
skipper, who had married the parson's daughter,
and now had a boy of his own for whom to plan
and dream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>That was the spring of his energy and caution&mdash;that
little boy, who could no more than toddle
over the kitchen floor and gurgle a greeting to
the lithe young fellow who bounded up the path
to catch him in his arms. The schooner was the
fortune of the lad and the mother; and she was
now all so nearly Job's own that another voyage
or two&mdash;a mere four months&mdash;might see the last
dollar of the obligation paid over.</p>

<p>"No," Skipper Job repeated, absently, when
he had thought of the toddler and the tender,
smiling mother, "I've no mind t' lose this here
schooner."</p>

<p>Job dreamed of the lad while he sipped his tea.
They must make a parson of him, if he had the
call, the skipper thought; or a doctor, perhaps.
Whatever, that baby must never follow the sea.
No, no! He must never know the hardship and
anxiety of such a night as that just past. He
must be&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>A scream of warning broke into the dream:</p>

<p>"Har-rd-a-lee!"</p>

<p>Skipper Job heard the fall of the feet of a man
leaping back from the bow. There was meaning
in the step, in the haste and length of the leaps&mdash;the
imminence of a collision with the ice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>"All hands!"</p>

<p>The skipper had no more than leaped to his
feet when there was a stunning crash overhead,
followed on the instant by a shock that stopped
the schooner dead and made her quiver from
stem to stern. The bowsprit was rammed into
the forecastle, the deck planks were ripped up,
the upper works of the bows were crushed in, the
cook's pots and pans were tumbled about, the
lamp was broken and extinguished. Job was
thrown from his feet.</p>

<p>When he recovered, it was to the horror of
this darkness and confusion&mdash;to a second crash
and shock, to screams and trampling overhead,
and to a rain of blows upon the deck. He cried
to the cook to follow him on deck, and felt his
way in mad haste to the ladder; but there he
stopped, of a sudden, with his foot on the lowest
step, for the cook had made no reply.</p>

<p>"Cook, b'y!" he shouted.</p>

<p>There was no answer. It was apparent that
the man had been killed or desperately injured.
The skipper knew the danger of delay. They
had struck ice; the berg might overturn, some
massive peak might topple over, the ship might
fill and sink. But, as a matter of course, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
with no thought of himself as a hero, he turned
and made a groping search for the cook, until he
found the poor fellow lying unconscious among
his own pots and pans. Thence he carried him
to the deck, and stretched him out on the fore
hatch, with the foreboom and sail to protect him
from the fragments of ice, which fell as in a
shower each time the schooner struck the berg.</p>

<p>Billy Topsail caught the skipper by the arm in
a strong grip.</p>

<p>"We're lost!" he cried.</p>

<p>The roaring wind, the hiss of the seas, the
shock and wreck, the sudden, dreadful peril, had
thrown the lad into a panic. The skipper perceived
his distress, and acted promptly to restore
him to his manhood.</p>

<p>"Leave me free!" he shouted, with a scowl.</p>

<p>But Billy tightened his grip on the skipper's
arm, and sobbed and whined. The skipper
knocked him down with a blow on the breast;
then jerked him to his feet and pointed to the
pump.</p>

<p>"Pump for your life!" he commanded, knowing
well that what poor Billy needed was work,
of whatever kind, to give him back his courage.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<div class='summary'><i>Faithfully Narrating the Amazing Experiences
of a Newfoundland Schooner and Describing
Billy Topsail's Conduct in a Sinking Boat</i></div>


<div class='drop-cap'>THE deck of the <i>Rescue</i> was now littered
with wreckage and casks. Splinters of
the jib-boom, all tangled with the standing
rigging, lay upon the forward deck. The
maintopmast had snapped off, and hung from
the mainmast in a tangle of wire and rope.
They had already cut the mainsail halyards, and
the big sail lay upon the boom, on the port side,
in disarrayed folds.</div>

<p>The bows were high out of the water, as if the
ship had run up a steep, submerged shelf of ice;
and the seas, which the wind of the night had
raised, from time to time broke over the stern.
It was impossible, however, to determine the
general situation of the schooner. The fog was
too thick for that, and the day had not yet fully
broken. All that was revealed, in a glance
about, was that upon one hand lay a waste of
breaking water, and upon the other a dull white
mass, lifting itself into the mist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Tis bad, lads," said the skipper, when the
first and second hands had joined him under the
mainmast shrouds.</p>

<p>"She's lost," said the first.</p>

<p>"We'll be takin' t' the boat," said the
second.</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure that she's lost," said the
skipper. "Whatever, we'll not take t' the boat
till we have to."</p>

<p>The first and second hands exchanged a
glance, and together looked at the boat. The
swift glance and look were a danger-signal to
the skipper.</p>

<p>"Does you hear me?" he shouted, his voice
ringing out above the wash of the waves and the
noise of the wind. "We'll not leave her. Take
a spell at the pump, both o' you!"</p>

<p>For a moment the skipper's authority was in
doubt. The men wavered. A repetition of the
command, however, with clenched fists ready to
enforce it, decided them. They relieved young
Billy.</p>

<p>"Is the water gainin', b'y?" said the skipper
to the lad.</p>

<p>Billy looked up steadily. The fright had left
his eyes. He had recovered his self-possession.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, sir," he said, quietly. "'Tis gettin' less
all the while."</p>

<p>At that moment the ship lurched slightly and
slid off the shelf. The skipper shouted an order
to raise the foresail, and ran aft to take the wheel.
But the fall of the topmast had so tangled the
rigging and jammed the gaff and boom that
before the crew could remove the unconscious
cook and lift the sail, the wind had turned the
schooner and was driving her stern foremost, as
it appeared, on the ice.</p>

<p>The skipper, from his station at the wheel,
calmly observed the nearing berg, and gave the
schooner up for lost. There was no time to raise
the sail&mdash;no room for beating out of danger.
He saw, too, that if she struck with force, the
quarter-boat, which was swinging from davits
astern, would be crushed to splinters.</p>

<p>"She's lost!" he thought. "Lost with all
hands!"</p>

<p>Nearer approach, however, disclosed the
strange fact that there was a break in the ice.
When the schooner was still a few fathoms
nearer, it was observed that the great berg was
in reality composed of two masses of ice, with a
narrow strait leading between them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>The light was now stronger, and the fog had
somewhat thinned; it was possible to distinguish
shadowy outlines&mdash;to see that great cliffs of ice
descended on each side of the passage to the
water's edge. Still deeper in the mist it was
lighter, as if the strait indeed led directly through
the berg to the open sea beyond. The crew was
gathered aft, breathlessly awaiting the schooner's
fate, helpless to fend or aid; and the cook was
lying on the roof of the cabin, where they had
laid him down, revived in part, and desperately
struggling to recover his senses.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 359px;">
<img src="images/i005.jpg" width="359" height="500" alt="boat caught between large ice cliffs" />
<div class="caption">"SHE'S LOST!" HE THOUGHT. "LOST WITH ALL HANDS."</div>
</div>

<p>"Lads," said the skipper, at last, "the Lord
has the schooner in His hands. They's a way
through the ice. He's guidin' her into it, but
whether He'll save us or not, He only knows."</p>

<p>The <i>Rescue</i> drifted fairly into the passage,
which was irregular, but in no part less than
twice the width of the vessel. She was swept
on, swinging from side to side, striking her bow
here and her stern there; and with every shock
fragments of rotten ice fell in a shower from
above.</p>

<p>How soon one might strike one of their number
down, no man knew. How soon some great
mass, now poised in the mist, might be dislodged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
and crush the schooner in its fall, no man knew.
How soon the towering cliffs might swing together
and grind the ship to splinters, no man
could tell. Were these masses of ice connected
deep down under water? Or were they floating
free?</p>

<p>There were no answers to these questions.
On went the schooner, stern foremost, slipping
ever nearer to the open.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>"Skipper, sir," the first hand pleaded, "leave
us launch the quarter-boat an' pull out. 'Tis&mdash;'tis&mdash;too
horrible here."</p>

<p>"Ay, lads, if you will," was the reply.</p>

<p>It was then discovered that a block of ice had
fallen in the boat at the bows, and sprung the
planking. She was too leaky to launch; there
was nothing for it but to wait.</p>

<p>"We'll calk those leaks as best we can," said
the skipper. "They's no tellin' what might&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The stern struck a projection, and the bow
swung round and lodged on the other side.
The schooner was jammed in the passage, almost
broadside to the wind. They made a shift
at calking the leaks with rags and a square of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
oiled canvas. At all hazards the schooner must
be freed.</p>

<p>"We must get her off quick, lads!" the skipper
cried. "Come, now, who's going with me
in the boat t' tow?"</p>

<p>"I, sir," said young Billy, stepping forward
eagerly.</p>

<p>"I, sir," said the first hand.</p>

<p>"So it is," said the skipper. "Andy, Tom,
when we hauls her bow off, do you stand here
with a gaff an' push. Lower away that boat,
now! Billy, do you fetch a bucket for bailin'."</p>

<p>The boat was launched with great difficulty
from her place in the stern davits. She began
at once to fill, for the calking had been ill done,
and she was sadly damaged. It took courage
to leap into her from the taffrail, leaky as she
was, and tossing about; but there was a desperate
sort of courage in the hearts of the men who
had volunteered, and they leaped, one by one.</p>

<p>Billy fell to bailing, and the skipper and the
first hand rowed forward to catch the line. The
line once caught and made fast, they pulled out
with might and main.</p>

<p>"She's fillin' fast, sir!" Billy gasped.</p>

<p>"Bail, b'y, bail!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>The tow-rope was now taut. The skipper and
the first hand pulled with such strength that each
stroke of an oar made a hissing little whirlpool.</p>

<p>"'Tis gainin' on me fast, sir," said Billy.</p>

<p>"Give way! Give way!" cried the skipper.</p>

<p>The bow of the schooner swung round inch by
inch&mdash;so slowly that the sinking of the boat
seemed inevitable.</p>

<p>"She'll sink, sir!" said Billy, in alarm, but still
bailing steadily.</p>

<p>"Pull! Pull!"</p>

<p>When the schooner was once more in her old
position&mdash;stern foremost, and driving slowly
through the passage&mdash;the water was within an
inch of the seats of the boat, which was now
heavy and almost unmanageable. Twenty
fathoms of water lay between the boat and the
bow of the schooner.</p>

<p>"She's goin' down, sir!" said Billy.</p>

<p>"Cast lines!" the skipper shouted to those
aboard.</p>

<p>Water curled over the gunwales. The boat
stopped dead, and wavered, on the point of sinking.
Two lines came whizzing towards her, uncoiling
in their flight. The one was caught by
the first hand, who threw himself into the water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
and was hauled aboard. Billy and the skipper
caught the other. With its help and a few
strong strokes they made the bow chains and
clambered to the deck.</p>

<p>"She's drivin' finely," said the skipper, when
he had looked around. "Stand by, there, an' be
ready with the fores'l! We'll soon be through."</p>

<p>It was true enough; in a few minutes the
schooner had safely drifted through the passage,
and was making off from the berg under a reefed
foresail, while the mist cleared and the sun shone
out, and the peaks and cliffs of the island of ice,
far astern, shone and glistened. And three days
later the young skipper bounded up the path at
Ruddy Cove, and the little toddler whom he
loved was at the kitchen door to greet him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<div class='summary'><i>In Which the Ruddy Cove Doctor Tells Billy Topsail
and a Stranger How He Came to Learn
that the Longest Way 'Round is Sometimes the
Shortest Way Home</i></div>


<div class='drop-cap'>IT was a quiet evening&mdash;twilight: with the
harbour water unruffled, and the colours of
the afterglow fast fading from the sky. Billy
Topsail and the doctor and a stranger sat by the
surgery door, watching the boats come in from
the sea, and their talk had been of the common
dangers of that life.</div>

<p>"It was a very narrow escape," said the
doctor.</p>

<p>"Crossing the harbour!" the stranger exclaimed.
"Why, 'tis not two hundred yards!"</p>

<p>"'Twas my narrowest escape&mdash;and 'twas all
because of Billy Topsail."</p>

<p>"Along o' <em>me!</em>" cried Billy.</p>

<p>"Ay," said the doctor; "'twas all along o' you.
Some years ago," he continued, "when you
were a toddler in pinafores, you were taken suddenly
ill. It was a warm day in the spring of
the year. The ice was still in the harbour, locked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
in by the rocks at the narrows, though the snow
had all melted from the hills, and green things
were shooting from the earth in the gardens.
The weather had been fine for a week," the
doctor continued, addressing the stranger, "Day
by day the harbour ice had grown more unsafe,
until, when Billy was taken ill, only the daring
ventured to cross upon it.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 387px;">
<img src="images/i006.jpg" width="387" height="500" alt="man talking to another seated man at desk" />
<div class="caption">"MY LITTLE LAD'S WONDERFUL SICK. COME QUICK!"</div>
</div>

<p>"Billy's father came rushing into the surgery
in a pitiable state of grief and fright. I knew
when I first caught sight of his face that Billy
was ill.</p>

<p>"'Doctor,' said he, 'my little lad's wonderful
sick. Come quick!'</p>

<p>"'Can we cross by the ice?' I asked.</p>

<p>"'I've come by that way,' said he. ''Tis safe
enough t' risk. Make haste, doctor, sir! Make
haste!'</p>

<p>"'Lead the way!' said I.</p>

<p>"He led so cleverly that we crossed without
once sounding the ice. It was a zigzag way&mdash;a
long, winding course&mdash;and I knew the day after,
though I was too intent upon the matter in hand
to perceive it at the moment, that only his experience
and acquaintance with the condition of the
ice made the passage possible. After midnight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
when my situation was one of extreme peril, I
realized that the way had been neither safe for
me, who followed, nor easy for the man who
led.</p>

<p>"'My boy is dying, doctor!' said the mother,
when we entered the house. 'Oh, save him!'</p>

<p>"My sympathy for the child and his parents,&mdash;they
loved that lad&mdash;no less than a certain professional
interest which takes hold of a young physician
in such cases, kept me at Billy's bedside until
long, long after dark. I need not have stayed so
long&mdash;ought not to have stayed&mdash;for the lad was
safe and out of pain; but in this far-away place a
man must be both nurse and doctor, and there I
found myself, at eleven o'clock of a dark night,
worn out, and anxious only to reach my bed by
the shortest way.</p>

<p>"'I thinks, sir,' said Billy's father, when I made
ready to go, 'that I wouldn't go back by the
ice.'</p>

<p>"'Oh, nonsense!' said I. 'We came over without
any trouble, and I'll find my way back, never
fear.'</p>

<p>"'I wisht you'd stay here the night,' said the
mother. 'If you'll bide, sir, we'll make you comfortable.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>"'No, no,' said I. 'I must get to my own
bed.'</p>

<p>"'If you'll not go round by the shore, sir,' said
the man, 'leave me pilot you across.'</p>

<p>"'Stay with your lad,' said I, somewhat testily.
'I'll cross by the ice.'</p>

<p>"''Twill be the longest way home the night,'
said he.</p>

<p>"When a man is sleepy and worn out he can
be strangely perverse. I would have my own
way; and, to my cost, I was permitted to take
it. Billy's father led me down to the landing-stage,
put a gaff in my hand, and warned me
to be careful&mdash;warned me particularly not to
take a step without sounding the ice ahead
with my gaff; and he brought the little lesson
to an end with a wistful, 'I wisht you wouldn't
risk it.'</p>

<p>"The tone of his voice, the earnestness and
warm feeling with which he spoke, gave me
pause. I hesitated; but the light in my surgery
window, shining so near at hand, gave me a vision
of comfortable rest, and I put the momentary
indecision away from me.</p>

<p>"'It is two hundred yards to my surgery by
the ice,' I said, 'and it is two miles round the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
harbour by the road. I'm going by the shortest
way.'</p>

<p>"'You'll find it the longest, sir,' said he.</p>

<p>"I repeated my directions as to the treatment
of little Billy, then gave the man good-night, and
stepped out on the ice, gaff in hand. The three
hours following were charged with more terror
and despair than, doubtless, any year of my life
to come shall know. I am not morbidly afraid
of death. It was not that&mdash;not the simple, natural
fear of death that made me suffer. It was
the manner of its coming&mdash;in the night, with the
harbour folk, all ignorant of my extremity, peacefully
sleeping around me&mdash;the slow, cruel approach
of it, closing in upon every hand, lying
all about me, and hidden from me by the night."</p>

<p>The doctor paused. He looked over the quiet
water of the harbour.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, repeating the short, nervous
laugh, "it was a narrow escape. The sun of
the afternoon&mdash;it had shone hot and bright&mdash;had
weakened the ice, and a strong, gusty wind, such
a wind as breaks up the ice every spring, was
blowing down the harbour to the sea. It had
overcast the sky with thick clouds. The night
was dark. Nothing more of the opposite shore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
than the vaguest outline of the hills&mdash;a blacker
shadow in a black sky&mdash;was to be seen.</p>

<p>"But I had the lamp in the surgery window to
guide me, and I pushed out from the shore, resolute
and hopeful. I made constant use of my
gaff to sound the ice. Without it I should have
been lost before I had gone twenty yards. From
time to time, in rotten places, it broke through
the ice with but slight pressure; then I had to
turn to right or left, as seemed best, keeping to
the general direction as well as I could all the
while.</p>

<p>"As I proceeded, treading lightly and cautiously,
I was dismayed to find that the condition
of the ice was worse than the worst I had feared.</p>

<p>"'Ah,' thought I, with a wistful glance towards
the light in the window, 'I'll be glad enough to
get there.'</p>

<p>"There were lakes of open water in my path;
there were flooded patches, sheets of thin, rubbery
ice, stretches of rotten 'slob.' I was not
even sure that a solid path to my surgery wound
through these dangers; and if path there were,
it was a puzzling maze, strewn with pitfalls, with
death waiting upon a misstep.</p>

<p>"Had it been broad day, my situation would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
have been serious enough. In the night, with
the treacherous places all covered up and hidden,
it was desperate. I determined to return;
but I was quite as unfamiliar with the lay of the
ice behind as with the path ahead. A moment
of thought persuaded me that the best plan was
the boldest&mdash;to push on for the light in the window.
I should have, at least, a star to guide me.</p>

<p>"'I have not far to go,' I thought. 'I must
proceed with confidence and a common-sense
sort of caution. Above all, I must <em>not</em> lose my
nerve.'</p>

<p>"It was easy to make the resolve; it was hard
to carry it out. When I was searching for solid
ice and my gaff splashed water, when the ice
offered no more resistance to my gaff than a
similar mass of sea-foam, when my foothold bent
and cracked beneath me, when, upon either side,
lay open water, and a narrowing, uncertain path
lay ahead, my nerve was sorely tried.</p>

<p>"At times, overcome by the peril I could not
see, I stopped dead and trembled. I feared to
strike my gaff, feared to set my foot down, feared
to quit the square foot of solid ice upon which I
stood. Had it not been for the high wind&mdash;high
and fast rising to a gale&mdash;I should have sat down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
and waited for the morning. But there were
ominous sounds abroad, and, although I knew
little about the ways of ice, I felt that the break-up
would come before the dawn. There was
nothing for it but to go on.</p>

<p>"And on I went; but at last&mdash;the mischance
was inevitable&mdash;my step was badly chosen. My
foot broke through, and I found myself, of a sudden,
sinking. I threw myself forward, and fell
with my arms spread out; thus I distributed my
weight over a wider area of ice and was borne up.</p>

<p>"For a time I was incapable of moving a
muscle; the surprise, the rush of terror, the shock
of the fall, the sudden relief of finding myself safe
for the moment had stunned me. So I lay still,
hugging the ice; for how long I cannot tell, but
I know that when I recovered my self-possession
my first thought was that the light was still burning
in the surgery window&mdash;an immeasurable
distance away. I must reach that light, I knew;
but it was a long time before I had the courage
to move forward.</p>

<p>"Then I managed to get the gaff under my
chest, so that I could throw some part of my
weight upon it, and began to crawl. The progress
was inch by inch&mdash;slow and toilsome, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
no moment of security to lighten it. I was
keenly aware of my danger; at any moment, as
I knew, the ice might open and let me in.</p>

<p>"I had gained fifty yards or more, and had
come to a broad lake, which I must round, when
the light in the window went out.</p>

<p>"'Elizabeth has given me up for the night,' I
thought in despair. 'She has blown out the light
and gone to bed.'</p>

<p>"There was now no point of light to mark my
goal. It was very dark; and in a few minutes I
was lost. I had the wind to guide me, it is true;
but I soon mistrusted the wind. It was veering,
it had veered, I thought; it was not possible for
me to trust it implicitly. In whatever direction I
set my face I fancied that the open sea lay that
way.</p>

<p>"Again and again I started, but upon each
occasion I had no sooner begun to crawl than I
fancied that I had mischosen the way. Of course
I cried for help, but the wind swept my frantic
screams away, and no man heard them. The
moaning and swish of the gale, as it ran past
the cottages, drowned my cries. The sleepers
were not alarmed.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile that same wind was breaking up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the ice. I could hear the cracking and grinding
long before I felt the motion of the pan upon
which I lay. But at last I did feel that mass of
ice turn and gently heave, and then I gave myself
up for lost.</p>

<p>"'Doctor! Doctor!'</p>

<p>"The voice came from far to windward. The
wind caught my answering shout and carried it
out to sea.</p>

<p>"'They will not hear me,' I thought. 'They
will not come to help me.'</p>

<p>"The light shone out from the surgery window
again. Then lights appeared in the neighbouring
houses, and passed from room to room.
There had been an alarm. But my pan was
breaking up! Would they find me in time?
Would they find me at all?</p>

<p>"Lanterns were now gleaming on the rocks
back of my wharf. Half a dozen men were coming
down on the run, bounding from rock to
rock of the path. By the light of the lanterns I
saw them launch a boat on the ice and drag it
out towards me. From the edge of the shore ice
they let it slip into the water, pushed off and
came slowly through the opening lanes of water,
calling my name at intervals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>"The ice was fast breaking and moving out.
When they caught my hail they were not long
about pushing the boat to where I lay. Nor, you
may be sure, was I long about getting aboard."</p>

<p>The doctor laughed nervously.</p>

<p>"Doctor," said the stranger, "how did they
know that you were in distress?"</p>

<p>"Oh," said the doctor, "it was Billy's father.
He was worried, and walked around by the shore.
When he found that I was not home, he roused
the neighbours."</p>

<p>"As the proverb runs," said the stranger, "the
longest way round is sometimes the shortest way
home."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the doctor, "I chose the longest
way."</p>

<p>Arch Butt's link in the long chain was from
Burnt Bay to Ruddy Cove. Once a week, come
wind, blizzard or blinding sunlight, with four dollars
and a half to reward him at the end of it, he
made the eighty miles of wilderness and sea, back
and forth, with the mail-bag on his broad back.</p>

<p>No man of the coast, save he, dared face that
stretch in all weathers. It may be that he
tramped a league, skated a league, sailed a
league, sculled a league, groped his way through
a league of night, breasted his way through a
league of wind, picked his way over a league of
shifting ice.</p>

<p>To be sure, he chose the way which best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
favoured his progress and least frayed the thread
upon which his life hung.</p>

<p>"Seems t' me, b'y," he said to his mate from
New Bay, when the great gale of '98 first appeared
in the northeast sky&mdash;"seems t' me we
<em>may</em> make Duck Foot Cove the night, safe
enough."</p>

<p>"Maybe, lad," was the reply, after a long, dubious
survey of the rising clouds. "Maybe we'll
get clear o' the gale, but 'twill be a close call,
whatever (at any rate)."</p>

<p>"Maybe," said Arch. "'Twould be well t' get
Her Majesty's mail so far as Duck Foot Cove,
whatever."</p>

<p>When Arch Butt made Duck Foot Cove that
night, he was on the back of his mate, who had
held to him, through all peril, with such courage
as makes men glorious. Ten miles up the bay,
his right foot had been crushed in the ice, which
the sea and wind had broken into unstable fragments.
Luff of New Bay had left him in the cottage
of Billy Topsail's uncle, Saul Ride, by the
Head, the only habitation in the cove, and made
the best of his own way to the harbours of the
west coast of the bay. Three days' delay stared
the Ruddy Cove mailman in the face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>"Will you not carry the mail t' Ruddy Cove,
Saul Ride?" he demanded, when he had dressed
his foot, and failed, stout as he was, to bear the
pain of resting his weight upon it.</p>

<p>"'Tis too far in a gale for my old legs," said
Ride, "an'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But 'tis Her Majesty's mail!" cried Arch.
"Won't you try, b'y?"</p>

<p>"An I had a chance t' make it, I'd try, quick
enough," said Ride sharply; "but 'twould be
not only me life, but the mail I'd lose. The ice
do be broken up 'tween here an' Creepy Bluff;
an' not even Arch Butt, hisself, could walk the
hills."</p>

<p>"Three days lost!" Arch groaned. "All the
letters three days late! An' all&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Letters!" Ride broke in scornfully. "Letters,
is it? Don't you fret about they. A love
letter for the parson's daughter; the price o' fish
from St. John's for the old skipper; an' a merchant's
account for every fisherman t' the harbour:
they be small things t' risk life for."</p>

<p>The mailman laid his hand on the leather bag
at his side. He fingered the government seal
tenderly and his eyes flashed splendidly when he
looked up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Tis Her Majesty's mail!" he said. "Her
Majesty's mail! Who knows what they be in
this bag. Maybe, b'y&mdash;maybe&mdash;maybe they's a
letter for old Aunt Esther Bludgel. She've
waited this three year for a letter from that boy,"
he continued. "Maybe <em>'tis</em> in there now. Sure,
b'y, an' I believe 'tis in there. Saul Ride, the
mail must go!"</p>

<p>A touch of the bruised foot on the floor brought
the mailman groaning to his chair again. If the
mail were to go to Ruddy Cove that night, it was
not to be carried on his back: that much was
evident. Saul Ride gazed at him steadily for a
moment. Something of the younger man's fine
regard for duty communicated itself to him.
There had been a time&mdash;the days of his strength&mdash;when
he, too, would have thought of duty before
danger. He went abstractly to the foot of
the loft stair.</p>

<p>"Billy!" he called. "Billy!"</p>

<p>"Ay, Uncle Saul," was the quick response.</p>

<p>"I wants you, b'y."</p>

<p>Billy Topsail came swiftly down the stair.
He was spending a week with his lonely Uncle
Saul at Duck Foot Cove. A summons at that
hour meant pressing service&mdash;need of haste.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
What was the call? Were they all well at
home? He glanced from one man to the other.</p>

<p>"B'y," said Ride, with a gesture towards the
mail-bag, "will you carry that bag to Ruddy
Cove? Will&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Will you carry Her Majesty's mail t' Ruddy
Cove?" Arch Butt burst out. His voice
thrilled Billy, as he continued: "Her Majesty's
mail!"</p>

<p>"'Tis but that black bag, b'y," Ride said
quietly. "Will you take it t' Ruddy Cove
t'-night? Please yourself about it."</p>

<p>"Ay," said Billy quickly. "When?"</p>

<p>"'Twill be light enough in four hours," said
the mailman.</p>

<p>"Go back t' bed, b'y," Ride said. "I'll wake
you when 'tis time t' be off."</p>

<p>Five minutes later the boy was sound asleep.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>No Newfoundlander ventures out upon the ice
without his gaff&mdash;a nine-foot pole, made of light,
tough dog-wood, and iron-shod. It was with
his own true gaff that Billy felt his way out of
Duck Foot Cove as the night cleared away.</p>

<p>The sea had abated somewhat with the wind.
In the bay beyond the cove, the broken ice was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
freezing into one vast, rough sheet, solid as the
coast rocks on the pans, but unsafe, and deceptive
over the channels between. The course
was down the bay, skirting the shore, to Creepy
Bluff, then overland to Ruddy Cove, which
is a port of the open sea: in all, twenty-one
miles, with the tail of the gale to beat against.</p>

<p>"Feel every step o' the way till the light
comes strong," had been old Saul Ride's last
word to the boy. "Strike hard with your gaff
before you put your foot down."</p>

<p>Billy kept his gaff before him&mdash;feeling his
way much as a blind man taps the pavement
as he goes along a city street. The search for
solid ice led him this way and that, but his
progress towards Creepy Bluff, the shadowy
outline of which he soon could see, steadily
continued. He surmised that it was still blowing
hard in the open, beyond the shelter of the
islands; and he wondered if the wind would
sweep him off his feet when he essayed to
cross Sloop Run, down which it ran, unbroken,
from the sea to the bluff.</p>

<p>"Her Majesty's mail!" he muttered, echoing
the thrill in the mailman's voice. "Her Majesty's
mail!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>When the light was stronger&mdash;but it was not
yet break of day&mdash;he thought to make greater
haste by risking more. Now and again he
chanced himself on a suspicious-looking black
sheet. Now and again he ran nimbly over
many yards of rubber ice, which yielded and
groaned, but did not break. Often he ventured
where Arch Butt would not have dared take his
massive body. All this he did, believing always
that he should not delay the Gull Arm mailman,
who might even then be waiting for him in
Ruddy Cove.</p>

<p>But when he had covered six miles of the
route, he came to a wide channel which was
not yet frozen over. It lay between two large
pans. How far he might have to diverge from
his course to cross without risk, he could not
tell. He was impressed with the fact that, once
across, the way lay clear before him&mdash;a long
stretch of solid ice.</p>

<p>"Sure, I must cross here," he thought.</p>

<p>He sought for a large cake of floating ice,
that he might ferry himself across with his gaff.
None great enough to bear his weight was to
be seen&mdash;none, at least, within reach of his gaff.
There were small cakes a-plenty; these were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
fragments heavy enough to bear him for but an
instant. Could he cross on them? He thought
he might leap from one to the other so swiftly
that none would be called upon to sustain his
full weight, and thus pass safely over.</p>

<p>With care he chose the path he would follow.
Then, without hesitation, he leaped for the first
cake&mdash;passed to the second&mdash;to the third&mdash;to the
fourth&mdash;stepping so lightly from one to the
other that the water did not touch the soles of
his boots. In a moment, he was whistling on
his way on the other side, leaving the channel
ice bobbing excitedly behind him.</p>

<p>Soon he broke off whistling and began to sing.
On he trudged, piping merrily:</p>

<div class='poem'>
'Way down on Pigeon Pond Island,<br />
When daddy comes home from swilin',<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Cakes and tea for breakfast,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pork and duff for dinner,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Cakes and tea for supper,</span><br />
'Way down on Pigeon Pond Island.<br />
</div>

<p>At noon he came to an expanse of bad ice.
He halted at the edge of it to eat a bit of the
hard bread and dried venison in his nunny-bag.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Then, forward again! He advanced with great
caution, sounding every step, on the alert for
thin places. A mile of this and he had grown
weary. He was not so quick, not so sure, in his
estimate of the strength of the ice. The wind,
now blowing in stronger gusts, brought the
water to his eyes and impaired his sight. He
did not regret his undertaking, but he began
ardently to wish that Creepy Bluff were nearer.
Thus moved, his pace increased&mdash;with ever-increasing
peril to himself. He must make
haste!</p>

<p>What befell the boy came suddenly. He
trusted his feet to a drift of snow. Quick as a
flash, and all unready, he was submerged in the
water beneath.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<div class='summary'><i>Billy Topsail Wrings Out His Clothes and Finds
Himself Cut off From Shore by Thirty Yards
of Heaving Ice</i></div>


<div class='drop-cap'>BILLY could swim&mdash;could swim like any
Newfoundland dog bred in Green Bay.
Moreover, the life he led&mdash;the rugged,
venturesome calling of the shore fishermen&mdash;had
inured him to sudden danger. First of all he
freed himself from the cumbersome mail-bag.
He would not have abandoned it had he not been
in such case as when, as the Newfoundlanders
say, it was "every hand for his life."</div>

<p>Then he made for the surface with swift, strong
strokes. A few more strokes brought him to the
edge of the ice. He clambered out, still gasping
for breath, and turned about to account to himself
for his predicament.</p>

<p>The drift of snow had collapsed; he observed
that it had covered some part of a wide hole, and
that the exposed water was almost of a colour
with the ice beyond&mdash;a polished black. Hence,
he did not bitterly blame himself for the false<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
step, as he might have done had he plunged
himself into obvious danger through carelessness.
He did not wonder that he had been
deceived.</p>

<p>Her Majesty's mail, so far as the boy could
determine, was slowly sinking to the bottom of
the bay.</p>

<p>There was no help in regret. To escape from
the bitter wind and the dusk, now fast falling,
was the present duty. He could think of all the
rest when he had leisure to sit before the fire and
dream. He took off his jacket and wrung it out&mdash;a
matter of some difficulty, for it was already
stiff with frost. His shirt followed&mdash;then his
boots and his trousers. Soon he was stripped to
his rosy skin. The wind, sweeping in from the
open sea, stung him as it whipped past.</p>

<p>When the last garment was wrung out he was
shivering, and his teeth were chattering so fast
that he could not keep them still. Dusk soon
turns to night on this coast, and the night comes
early. There was left but time enough to reach
the first of the goat-paths at Creepy Bluff, two
miles away&mdash;not time to finish the overland
tramp to Ruddy Cove&mdash;before darkness fell.</p>

<p>When he was about to dress, his glance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
chanced to pass over the water. The mail-bag&mdash;it
could be nothing else&mdash;was floating twenty-yards
off the ice. It had been prepared with
cork for such accidents, which not infrequently
befall it.</p>

<p>"'Tis Her Majesty's mail, b'y," Billy could
hear the mailman say.</p>

<p>"But 'tis more than I can carry t' Ruddy Cove
now," he thought.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he made no move to put on his
shirt. He continued to look at the mail-bag.
"'Tis the mail&mdash;gov'ment mail," he thought
again. Then, after a rueful look at the water:
"Sure, nobody'll know that it floated. 'Tis as
much as I can do t' get myself safe t' Gull Cove.
I'd freeze on the way t' Ruddy Cove."</p>

<p>There was no comfort in these excuses. There,
before him, was the bag. It was in plain sight.
It had not sunk. He would fail in his duty to
the country if he left it floating there. It was an
intolerable thought!</p>

<p>"'Tis t' Ruddy Cove I'll take that bag this
day," he muttered.</p>

<p>He let himself gingerly into the water, and
struck out. It was bitter cold, but he persevered,
with fine courage, until he had his arm safely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
linked through the strap of the bag. It was the
country he served! In some vague form this
thought sounded in his mind, repeating itself
again and again, while he swam for the ice with
the bag in tow.</p>

<p>He drew himself out with much difficulty,
hauled the mail-bag after him, and proceeded to
dress with all speed. His clothes were frozen
stiff, and he had to beat them on the ice to soften
them; but the struggle to don them sent the rich
blood rushing through his body, and he was
warmed to a glow.</p>

<p>On went the bag, and off went the boy. When
he came to the firmer ice, and Creepy Bluff was
within half a mile, the wind carried this cheery
song up the bay:</p>

<div class='poem'>
Lukie's boat is painted green,<br />
The finest boat that ever was seen;<br />
Lukie's boat has cotton sails,<br />
A juniper rudder and galvanized nails.<br />
</div>

<p>At Creepy Bluff, which the wind strikes with
full force, the ice was breaking up inshore. The
gale had risen with the coming of the night.
Great seas spent their force beneath the ice&mdash;cracking
it, breaking it, slowly grinding it to
pieces against the rocks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>The Bluff marks the end of the bay. No ice
forms beyond. Thus the waves swept in with
unbroken power, and were fast reducing the
shore cakes to a mass of fragments. Paul was
cut off from the shore by thirty yards of heaving
ice. No bit of it would bear his weight; nor, so
fine had it been ground, could he leap from place
to place as he had done before.</p>

<p>"'Tis sprawl I must," he thought.</p>

<p>The passage was no new problem. He had
been in such case more than once upon his return
from the offshore seal-hunt. Many fragments
would together bear him up, where few would
sink beneath him. He lay flat on his stomach,
and, with the gaff to help support him, crawled
out from the solid place, dragging the bag. His
body went up and down with the ice. Now an
arm was thrust through, again a leg went under
water.</p>

<p>Progress was fearfully slow. Inch by inch he
gained on the shore&mdash;crawling&mdash;crawling
steadily. All the while he feared that the great
pans would drift out and leave the fragments
room to disperse. Once he had to spread wide
his arms and legs and pause until the ice was
packed closer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>"Two yards more&mdash;only two yards more!" he
could say at last.</p>

<p>Once on the road to Ruddy Cove, which he
well knew, his spirits rose; and with a cheery
mood came new strength. It was a rough road,
up hill and down again, through deep snowdrifts
and over slippery rocks. Night fell; but there
was light enough to show the way, save in the
deeper valleys, and there he had to struggle along
as best he might.</p>

<p>Step after step, hill after hill, thicket after
thicket: cheerfully he trudged on; for the mail-bag
was safe on his back, and Ruddy Cove was
but three miles distant. Three was reduced to
two, two to one, one to the last hill.</p>

<p>From the crest of Ruddy Rock he could look
down on the lights of the harbour&mdash;yellow lights,
lying in the shadows of the valley. There was a
light in the post-office. They were waiting for
him there&mdash;waiting for their letters&mdash;waiting to
send the mail on to the north. In a few minutes
he could say that Her Majesty's mail had been
brought safe to Ruddy Cove.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Be the mail come?"</p>

<p>Billy looked up from his seat by the roaring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
fire in the post-office. An old woman had come
in. There was a strange light in her eyes&mdash;the
light of a hope which survives, spite of repeated
disappointment.</p>

<p>"Sure, Aunt Esther; 'tis here at last."</p>

<p>"Be there a letter for me?"</p>

<p>Billy hoped that there was. He longed to see
those gentle eyes shine&mdash;to see the famished look
disappear.</p>

<p>"No, Aunt Esther; 'tis not come yet. Maybe
'twill come next&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sure, I've waited these three year," she said,
with a trembling lip. "'Tis from me son&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ha!" cried the postmaster. "What's this?
'Tis all blurred by the water. 'Missus E&mdash;s&mdash;B&mdash;l&mdash;g&mdash;e&mdash;l.'
Sure, 'tis you, woman. 'Tis a
letter for you at last!"</p>

<p>"'Tis from me son!" the old woman muttered
eagerly. "'Tis t' tell me where he is, an'&mdash;an'&mdash;when
he's comin' home. Thank God, the mail
came safe the night."</p>

<p>What if Billy had left the mail-bag to soak and
sink in the waters of the bay? What if he had
failed in his duty to the people? How many
other such letters might there not be in that bag
for the mothers and fathers of the northern ports?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank God," he thought, "that Her Majesty's
mail came safe the night!"</p>

<p>Then he went off home, and met Bobby Lot
on the way.</p>

<p>"Hello!" said Bobby. "Got back?"</p>

<p>"Hello yourself!" said Billy. "I did."</p>

<p>They eyed each other delightedly; they were
too boyish to shake hands.</p>

<p>"How's the ice?" asked Bobby Lot.</p>

<p>"Not bad," said Billy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<div class='summary'><i>In Which Billy Topsail Joins the Whaler Viking
and a School is Sighted</i></div>


<div class='drop-cap'>OF a sunny afternoon the Newfoundland
coastal steamer <i>Clyde</i> dropped Billy
Topsail at Snook's Arm, the lair of the
whaler <i>Viking:</i> a deep, black inlet of the sea,
fouled by the blood and waste flesh of forgotten
victims, from the slimy edge of which, where a
score of whitewashed cottages were squatted,
the rugged hills lifted their heads to the clean
blue of the sky and fairly held their noses. It
was all the manager's doing. Billy had but given
him direction through the fog from Mad Mull to
the landing place of the mail-boat. This was at
Ruddy Cove, in the spring, when the manager
was making an annual visit to the old skipper.</div>

<p>"If you want a berth for the summer, Billy,"
he had said, "you can be ship's boy on the
<i>Viking</i>."</p>

<p>On the <i>Viking</i>&mdash;the whaler! Billy was not in
doubt. And so it came to pass, in due course of
time, that the <i>Clyde</i> dropped him at Snook's
Arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>At half-past three of the next morning, when the
dark o' night was but lightened by a rosy promise
out to sea, the <i>Viking's</i> lines were cast off. At
half speed the little steamer moved out upon the
quiet waters of the Arm, where the night still lay
thick and cold&mdash;slipped with a soft chug! chug!
past the high, black hills; factory and cottages
melting with the mist and shadows astern, and
the new day glowing in the eastern sky. She
was an up-to-date, wide-awake little monster,
with seventy-five kills to her credit in three
months, again composedly creeping from the lair
to the hunt, equipped with deadly weapons of
offense.</p>

<p>"'Low we'll get one the day, sir?" Billy asked
the cook.</p>

<p>"Wonderful quiet day," replied the cook, dubiously.
"'Twill be hard fishin'."</p>

<p>The fin-back whale is not a stupid, passive
monster, to be slaughtered off-hand; nor is the
sea a well-ordered shambles. Within the experience
of the <i>Viking's</i> captain, one fin-back wrecked
a schooner with a quick slap of the tail, and
another looked into the forecastle of an iron
whaler from below. The fin-back is the biggest,
fleetest, shyest whale of them all; until an ingenious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Norwegian invented the harpoon gun,
they wallowed and multiplied in the Newfoundland
waters undisturbed. They were quite safe
from pursuit; no whaler of the old school
dreamed of taking after them in his cockle shell&mdash;they
were too wary and fleet for that.</p>

<p>"Ay," the cook repeated; "on a day like this
a whale can <em>play</em> with the <i>Viking</i>."</p>

<p>The <i>Viking</i> was an iron screw-steamer,
designed for chasing whales, and for nothing else.
She was mostly engines, winches and gun. She
could slip along, without much noise, at sixteen
knots an hour; and she could lift sixty tons from
the bottom of the sea with her little finger. Her
gun&mdash;the swivel gun, with a three-inch bore,
pitched at the bow, clear of everything&mdash;could
drive a four-foot, 123-pound harpoon up to the
hilt in the back of a whale if within range; and
the harpoon itself&mdash;it protruded from the muzzle
of the gun, with the rope attached to the shaft
and coiled below&mdash;was a deadly missile. It was
tipped with an iron bomb, which was designed to
explode in the quarry's vitals when the rope
snapped taut, and with half a dozen long barbs,
which were to spread and take hold at the same
instant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," Billy Topsail sighed, his glance on
the gun and the harpoon, "if they hits a whale,
that there arrow ought t' do the work!"</p>

<p>"It does," said the cook, quietly.</p>

<p>All morning long, they were all alive on deck&mdash;every
man of that Norwegian crew, from the
grinning man in the crow's nest, which was
lashed to a stubby yellow mast, to the captain on
the gun platform, with the glass to his eyes, and
the stokers who stuck their heads out of the engine
room for a breath of fresh air. The squat,
grim little <i>Viking</i> was speeding across Notre
Dame Bay, with a wide, frothy wake behind her,
and the water curling from her bows. She was
for all the world like a man making haste to business
in the morning, the appointment being, in
this case, off a low, gray coast, which the lifting
haze was but then disclosing.</p>

<p>It was broad day: the sea was quiet, the sun
shining brightly, the sky a cloudless blue; a
fading breeze ruffled the water, and the ripples
flashed in the sunlight. Dead ahead and far
away, where the gray of the coast rocks shaded
to the blue of the sea, little puffs of spray were
drifting off with the light wind, like the puff of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
smoke from a distant rifle: they broke and
drifted and vanished.</p>

<p>From time to time mirror-flashes of light&mdash;swift
little flashes&mdash;struck Billy's eyes and darted
away. Puff after puff of spray, flash after flash
of light: the far-off sea seemed to be alive with
the quarry. But where was the thrilling old cry
of "There she blows!" or its Norwegian equivalent?
The lookout had but spoken a quiet word
to the captain, who, in turn, had spoken a quiet
word to the steersman.</p>

<p>"W'ales," said the captain, whose English had
its limitations. "Ho&mdash;far off!"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<div class='summary'><i>In which the Chase is Kept up and the Captain
Promises Himself a Kill</i></div>


<div class='drop-cap'>THE number of whales was less than the
captain of the <i>Viking</i> had thought. When
the vessel came up with the school, however,
there were twenty or more fin-backs to pick
and choose from. They lay on every hand, wallowing
at the surface of the sea and spouting
thick, low streams of water with evident delight:
whales far and near, big and small, in pairs and
threes, rising and gently sinking, blowing and
<em>hon-g-king</em>, and, at last, arching their broad,
finned backs for the long dive.</div>

<p>The breathing spell was of two or three minutes'
duration, the dive of five or ten, and might
last much longer. Billy was told that as the
whales went thus, rising and diving, they travelled
in a circle, feeding on young caplin and herring,
squid and crustaceans. He had never thought
to admire the grace of a whale; but his admiration
was compelled: the ponderous, ill-proportioned
monsters were so perfectly adapted to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
element they were in that the languor and grace
with which they moved was a delight&mdash;particularly
when they arched their glistening black
backs and softly, languidly vanished.</p>

<p>But meantime the <i>Viking</i> was lying silent and
still; and&mdash;</p>

<p>"<em>Hon-g-k!</em>" from off the port bow.</p>

<p>"Ha!" exclaimed the captain.</p>

<p>A big whale had risen. The long "<em>Hon-g-k!</em>"
as he had inhaled a small cyclone of breath was
sufficient to tell that. He was big and he was
near.</p>

<p>"Full speed!" quietly from the captain in
Norwegian.</p>

<p>The steersman had already spun the wheel
without orders. The <i>Viking</i> swung in a half
circle and made for the whale at top speed.
There was just a quiver of excitement abroad&mdash;a
deepening glitter in the eyes of the crew, and
silence. The rush was upon the whale from behind&mdash;instant,
swift, straight: the engines chug-chugged
and the water swished noisily at the
bows. There was no lying in ambush, no stalking:
it was sight your game and make for
him.</p>

<p>The captain leaned lazily on the gun, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
he had not yet swung into position for firing;
his legs were crossed, though the whale was not
a hundred yards away, and he was placidly
smoking his pipe. The fin-back lay dead ahead
now, apparently unconscious of the <i>Viking's</i> approach,
and she was soon so near that his escape
seemed to Billy to be beyond the barest chance.
The captain waved his hand, calmly looked over
the sea, and fell again into his careless position,
with one eye on the whale.</p>

<p>At once the engines stopped and the <i>Viking</i>
slipped softly on with diminishing speed. When
she was within thirty yards of the whale, each
separate muscle of Billy's body was tight with
excitement&mdash;but the whale arched his back and
slipped down deep into the water with a contemptuous
swing of his broad, strong tail.</p>

<p>"Psh-h!" exclaimed the captain, giving one
slippered foot a kick with the other. "Psh!"</p>

<p>They were running over a stretch of frothy,
swirling water, where the whale had lain a moment
before.</p>

<p>"<em>Hon-g-k!</em>" from off the starboard quarter.</p>

<p>The captain signaled the steersman, who
shouted "Full speed!" down the wheel-house
tube. In a flash they were chug-chugging in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
haste after another whale&mdash;which eluded them
at once, with no more fuss than the first had
made: no blowing and frantic splashing; just a
lifting of the back and a languid swing of the
tail. Thus the third, the fourth, the fifth:
again and again, through the hours of that quiet
morning, they gave chase; but all to no purpose&mdash;on
the contrary, indeed, with the bad effect of
alarming the whole school. The whales made
sport of them; the flash of their fins, as they
slipped away beyond pursuit, was most aggravating.</p>

<p>Soon the captain's "Psh!" became guttural,
and communicated itself to the man in the crow's-nest
and the engineer who was off duty; the
elusive fin-backs were too much for the patience
of them all. But for hours the "old man" leaned
on the gun and smoked his pipe, intent on the
chase through every moment of that time. He
kicked his right foot with his left; his broad back
shook with rage; strange ejaculations drifted
back with the clouds of tobacco smoke: that was
all. Repeated disappointment but heightened
the alertness and eagerness of the crew. Every
lost whale was dismissed with a "Psh-h!" and
quite forgotten in the pursuit of the next one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>Nine hours out from Snook's Arm and six
with the school without pointing a gun!</p>

<p>"Agh!" the captain exclaimed, jumping from
the gun platform, at last, "the whale captain
have the worst business of all men. Agh! but I
wish for rough seas. But I wish I had my harpoon
in the back of some whale."</p>

<p>All days are not blue. Before the summer was
over, Billy Topsail learned there were times when
the <i>Viking</i> put out from the shelter of Snook's
Arm to a sea that <em>is</em> rough. A gale from the
northeast, gray and gusty, whips up the white
horses, and frost gives new weight to the water.
Wind and fog and high seas and sleet make the
chase perilous as well as bitter. She stumbles
through the waves and wallows in the trough with
a clear-cut duty before her&mdash;to catch and kill a
whale: the little niceties of dodging breaking
waves cannot be indulged in when all man&oelig;vering
must be directed towards coming up with the
quarry from the proper firing-quarter.</p>

<p>But Billy's first day was clear and quiet; and
the whales were having a glorious innings with
the enemy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>By noon the prospects for a kill had faded to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
bare possibility; the school had been well scattered.
Down the coast and up the coast, out to
sea and far away across the bay, puffs of spray
made known the various directions the whales
had taken. About two o'clock&mdash;ten hours out
from Snook's Arm, with no let up in duty&mdash;the
crew were attracted by the deep, long <em>hon-g-k</em> of
a big fellow out to sea and by the spouting of his
two companions: a group of three, male and
female, doubtless, with a well-grown young one.
They gave chase. Captain and crew had come
to that pass when fury gets the better of patience.</p>

<p>It was determined to hunt that little school to
the death or until deep night put an end to the
chase.</p>

<p>"I get 'im," said the captain between his teeth.
"He is big. I get him&mdash;or none."</p>

<p>It was not easy to get him. They were led
twenty miles to sea in short rushes, each of which
ended in disappointment and elicited a storm of
guttural ejaculations; they were lured inshore,
where submerged rocks were a menace; they
were taken up the coast and back again towards
the islands of the lower shore and once more to
sea. Mile after mile&mdash;hour after hour! They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
came near&mdash;they could have hit the beast with a
stone. Occasionally the captain swung the gun
into position and put a hand on the trigger; but
the arching back always gave notice, in good
time, that he had been balked again. They tried
to guess the point where the quarry would rise;
they steamed near that point, and lay there waiting.</p>

<p>"<em>Hon-g-k!</em>" from half a mile astern.</p>

<p>"Agh!" cried the captain, chagrin twisting
his face. "The whale captain have pos&mdash;ee&mdash;tiv&mdash;lee
the worst&mdash;&mdash;! Full speed!"</p>

<p>Off again in persistent chase. Meantime the
sun had declined; evening was drawing on, with
gray clouds mounting in the west, and a breeze
rising inshore. The sea was spread with shadow,
and all the ripples grew to little waves, which,
hissing as they broke, obscured the swish of
water at our bows. The opportunity was better,
and the whales, it may be, had acquired the inevitable
contempt that familiarity breeds. The
<i>Viking</i> crept nearer. Each time, a little nearer;
and, by and by, when she had come within range&mdash;within
range for the first time that day&mdash;and
was running at half speed, with the grayish-black
backs most temptingly exposed, the captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
dropped the muzzle of the gun, took swift sight,
and&mdash;swung the gun around with impatient
force! The whale was gone on the long dive before
a vital spot had been exposed.</p>

<p>There was no impatience of action aboard the
<i>Viking:</i> the harpoon might even then have been
fast in the whale's back, but the captain had
coolly withheld his stroke until the opportunity
should be precisely what he sought. And this
display of patience after a fruitless chase of fifteen
hours! Billy Topsail gasped his disappointment.
But the captain laughed.</p>

<p>"I get him yet," he said. "Soon, now," after
a look at sea and darkening sky.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<div class='summary'><i>The Mate of the Fin-Back Whale Rises for the
Last Time, With a Blood-Red Sunset Beyond,
and Billy Topsail Says, "Too bad!"</i></div>


<div class='drop-cap'>HALF a mile ahead the whales rose.
The <i>Viking</i> crept near without giving
alarm, and waited for them to dive and
rise again. The warning swish and <em>hon-g-k</em>
sounded next from off the port bow. There was
a shout from the crew. The school lay close in,
headed away; they were splashing and blissfully
<em>hon-g-king</em>&mdash;and the <i>Viking</i> not fifty yards distant.
She was upon them from behind before
they had well drawn breath. Steam was shut off.
The captain's eye was at the butt of the gun, and
his hand was on the trigger. The boat crept
nearer&mdash;so near that Billy Topsail could have
leaped from the bow to the back of the young
whale; and she was fast losing way.</div>

<p>But it was not the young whale that the
captain wanted. He held his fire. Down went
the young one. Down went the bull whale.
But had he arched his back? The old female
wallowed a moment longer and dived with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
arched back. She barely escaped the <i>Viking's</i>
bows and might have been mortally harpooned
with ease. But it was not the female that the
captain wanted. It was the big male. There
was not a whale in sight. Still the captain kept
his eye at the butt of the gun and his hand on
the trigger.</p>

<p>A moment later&mdash;the steamer was slipping
along very slowly&mdash;the water ahead was disturbed.
The back of the bull whale appeared.
A stream of water shot into the air and broke
like a fountain. The <i>Viking</i> kept pace&mdash;gained;
momentarily creeping nearer, until the range
was but ten yards. Then the whale, as though
taking alarm, arched his back; and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Bang!</p>

<p>The puff of smoke drifted away. Billy Topsail
caught sight of the harpoon, sunk to the hilt
in the whale's side. Then the waters closed over
the wounded beast.</p>

<p>"Ha!" cried the captain, jumping from the
platform, and strutting about with his thumbs in
the armholes of his waistcoat. "Did you see
me? Ha! It is over!"</p>

<p>A cheer broke from the crew. The men ran
forward to their stations at the winch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ha!" the captain repeated with intense
satisfaction, his ruddy face wreathed in smiles.
"Did you see me? Ha-a-a-a! It is a dead
w'ale."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 330px;">
<img src="images/i007.jpg" width="330" height="500" alt="men looking over side of ship into water" />
<div class="caption">"IT IS A DEAD W'ALE!"</div>
</div>

<p>The harpoon line was paying out slowly, controlled
by a big steam winch&mdash;a gigantic fishing
reel. The engines were stopped; but the
<i>Viking</i> was going forward at a lively rate as
the catch plunged down and on. Minute after
minute slipped away&mdash;five minutes; then the
rope slackened somewhat, and, a moment later,
the big whale came to the surface and spouted
streams of blood&mdash;streams as red as the streak
of sunset light in the gray sky beyond him. He
floundered there in agony, blowing and <em>hon-g-king</em>
and beating the sea with his tail: turning
the water crimson with his blood.</p>

<p>It took him a long, long time to die, frightfully
torn by the bomb though he was. He dived
and rose and coughed; and at last he sank
slowly down, down, and still down; drawing out
a hundred and forty fathom of line: straight
down to the bottom of the sea in that place.
From time to time the captain touched the rope
with his fingers; and when the tremour of life
had passed from it he gave the signal to haul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
away. Half an hour later the carcass of the
monster was inflated with gas, lying belly up at
the surface of the water, and lashed by the tail
to the port bow of the steamer.</p>

<p>Off the starboard quarter&mdash;far away where
the dusk had gathered&mdash;the mate of the dead
whale rose, <em>hon-g-ked</em>, dived and was seen no
more.</p>

<p>"Too bad!" muttered Billy Topsail.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<div class='summary'><i>In Which Billy Topsail Goes Fishing in Earnest.
Concerning, also, Feather's Folly of the Devil's
Teeth, Mary Robinson, and the Wreck of the
Fish Killer</i></div>


<div class='drop-cap'>FEATHER'S FOLLY was one of a group
of troublesome islands lying off Cape Grief
on the way to the Labrador. Surveyed by
a generously inaccurate apprentice it might have
measured an acre. It was as barren as an old
bone; but a painstaking man, with unimpaired
eyesight, if he lingered long and lovingly enough
over the task, could doubtless have discovered
more than one blade of grass. There is no adjective
in the English language adequate to
describe its forbidding appearance as viewed
from the sea in a gale of wind.</div>

<p>On the chart it was a mere dot&mdash;a nameless
rock, the outermost of a group most happily
called the Devil's Teeth. To the Labrador fishermen,
bound north from Newfoundland in the
spring, bound south, with their loads of green
cod, in the fall, it was the Cocked Hat. This
name, too, is aptly descriptive; many a schooner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
caught in the breakers, had, as the old proverb
hath it, been knocked into that condition, or
worse. But to the folk of the immediate coast,
and especially of Hulk's Harbour, which lies
within sight on the mainland, it was for long
known as Feather's Folly.</p>

<p>Old Bill Feather had once been wrecked on
the Cocked Hat. The little <i>Lucky Lass</i>, bound
to Hulk's Harbour from the Hen-and-Chickens,
and sunk to the scupper-holes with green fish,
had struck in a fog. Four minutes later she had
gone down with all hands save Bill. An absentminded
breaker had deposited him high and dry
on a ledge of the northeast cliff; needless to say,
it was much to Bill's surprise. For five days the
castaway had shivered and starved on the barren
rock. This was within sight of the chimney-smoke
of home&mdash;of the harbour tickle, of the
cottage roofs; even, in clear weather, of the flakes
and stage of his own place.</p>

<p>"It won't happen again," vowed Bill, when
they took his lean, sore hulk home.</p>

<p>What Bill did&mdash;what he planned and accomplished
in the face of ridicule and adverse fortune&mdash;earned
the rock the name of Feather's Folly in
that neighbourhood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>"Anyhow," old Bill was in the habit of repeating,
to defend himself, "I 'low it won't happen
again. An' I'll <em>see</em> that it don't!"</p>

<p>But season followed season, without event;
and the Cocked Hat was still known as Feather's
Folly.</p>

<p>Billy Topsail was to learn this.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was early in the spring of the year&mdash;too
early by half, the old salts said, for Labrador
craft to put out from the Newfoundland ports.
Thick, vagrant fogs, drifting with the variable
winds, were abroad on all the coast; and the
Arctic current was spread with drift ice from the
upper shores and with great bergs from the
glaciers of the far north. But Skipper Libe Tussel,
of the thirty-ton <i>Fish Killer</i>, hailing from
Ruddy Cove, was a firm believer in the fortunes
of the early bird; moreover, he was determined
that the skipper of the <i>Cod Trap</i>, hailing from
Fortune, should not this season preëmpt his
trap-berth on the Thigh Bone fishing grounds.
So the <i>Fish Killer</i> was underway for the north,
early as it was; and she was cheerily game to
face the chances of wind and ice, if only she
might beat the <i>Cod Trap</i> to the favourable opportunities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
of the Thigh Bone grounds off Indian
Harbour.</p>

<p>"It's thick," Robinson remarked to the
skipper.</p>

<p>"<em>'Tis</em> thick."</p>

<p>Billy Topsail, now grown old enough for the
adventurous voyage to the Labrador coast, was
aboard; and he listened to this exchange with
a deal of interest. It was his first fishing voyage;
he had been north in the <i>Rescue</i>, to be sure,
but that was no more than a cruise, undertaken
to relieve the starving fishermen of the upper
harbours. At last, he was fishing in earnest&mdash;really
aboard the <i>Fish Killer</i>, bound north, there
to fish the summer through, in all sorts of weather,
with a share in the catch at the end of it! He
was vastly delighted by this: for 'twas a man's
work he was about, and 'twas a man's work he
was wanting to do.</p>

<p>"Thick as mud," said Robinson, with a little
shiver.</p>

<p>"'S mud," the skipper responded, in laconic
agreement.</p>

<p>And it <em>was</em> thick! The fog had settled at mid-day.
A fearsome array of icebergs had then been
in sight, and the low coast, with the snow still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
upon it, had to leeward shone in the brilliant
sunlight. But now, with the afternoon not yet
on the wane, the day had turned murky and
damp. A bank of black fog had drifted in from
the open sea. Ice and shore had disappeared.
The limit of vision approached, possibly, but did
not attain, twenty-five yards. The weather was
thick, indeed; the schooner seemed to be winging
along through a boundless cloud; and there
was a smart breeze blowing, and the circle of sea,
in the exact centre of which the schooner floated,
was choppy and black.</p>

<p>"Thick enough," Skipper Libe echoed,
thoughtfully. "But," he added, "you wouldn't
advise heavin' to, would you?"</p>

<p>"No, no!" Robinson exclaimed. "I'm too
anxious to get to Indian Harbour."</p>

<p>"And I," muttered the skipper, with an anxious
look ahead, "to make the Thigh Bone grounds.
But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Give her all the wind she'll carry," said
Robinson. "It won't bother me."</p>

<p>"I thinks," the skipper continued, ignoring the
interruption, "that I'll shorten sail. For," said
he, "I'm thinkin' the old girl might bleed at the
nose if she happened t' bump a berg."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>While the crew reduced the canvas, Robinson
went below. He was the Hudson's Bay Company's
agent at Dog Arm of the Labrador,
which is close to Indian Harbour. In January,
with his invalid daughter in a dog-sled, he had
journeyed from that far place to Desolate Bay of
Newfoundland, and thence by train to St. John's.
It had been a toilsome, dangerous, incredibly
bitter experience. But he had forgotten that,
nor had he ever complained of it; his happiness
was that his child had survived the surgeons'
operation, had profited in ease and hope, had already
been restored near to her old sunny health.
Early in the spring, word of the proposed sailing
of the <i>Fish Killer</i> from Ruddy Cove had come
to him at St. John's; and he had taken passage
with Skipper Libe, no more, it must be said, because
he wished Mary's mother to know the good
news (she had had no word since his departure)
than because he was breathlessly impatient once
more to be serving the company's interests at
Dog Arm.</p>

<p>To Mary and her father Skipper Libe had
with seamanlike courtesy abandoned the tiny
cabin. The child was lying in the skipper's own
berth&mdash;warmly covered, comfortably tucked in,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
provided with a book to read by the light of the
swinging lamp.</p>

<p>"Are you happy, dear?" her father asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!"</p>

<p>The man took the child's hand. "I'm sometimes
sorry," he said, "that we didn't wait for
the mail-boat. The <i>Fish Killer</i> is a pretty tough
craft for a little girl to be aboard."</p>

<p>"Sorry?" was the instant response, made with
a little smile. "I'm not. I'm glad. Isn't Cape
Grief close to leeward? Well, then, father, we're
half way home. Think of it! <em>We're&mdash;half&mdash;way&mdash;home!</em>"</p>

<p>The father laughed.</p>

<p>"And we might have been waiting at St.
John's," the child continued, her blue eyes shining.
"Oh, father, I'd rather be aboard the <i>Fish
Killer</i> off Grief Head than in the very best room
of the Crosbie Hotel. Half way home!" she
repeated. "Half way home!"</p>

<p>"Half way is a long way."</p>

<p>"But it's half way!"</p>

<p>"On this coast," the father sighed, "no man
is home until he gets there."</p>

<p>"It's a fair wind."</p>

<p>"And the fog as thick as mud."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>"But they've reefed the mains'l; they've
stowed the stays'l; they've got the tops'l down.
Haven't you heard them? I've been listening&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<em>What's that!</em>" Robinson cried.</p>

<p>It was a mere ejaculation of terror. He had
no need to ask the question. Even Mary knew
well enough what had happened. The <i>Fish
Killer</i> had struck an iceberg bow on. The
shock; the crash forward; the clatter of a falling
topmast; the cries on deck: these things were
alive with the fearful information.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<div class='summary'><i>The Crew of the Fish Killer Finds Refuge on an
Iceberg, and Discovers Greater Safety Elsewhere,
after Which the Cook is Mistaken for a
Fool, but puts the Crew to Shame</i></div>


<div class='drop-cap'>ROBINSON caught the child from the
berth. He paused&mdash;it was an instinct
born of Labrador experience&mdash;to wrap a
blanket about her, though she was clothed for the
day. She reminded him quietly that she would
catch cold without her cap; and this he snatched
in passing. Then he was on deck&mdash;in the midst
of a litter from aloft and of a vast confusion of
terrified cries.</div>

<p>Before she struck, the <i>Fish Killer</i> had ascended
a gently shelving beach of ice, washed smooth by
the sea. There she hung precariously. Her
stem was low, so low that the choppy sea came
aboard and swamped the cabin; and the bow was
high on the ice. Her bowsprit was in splinters,
her topmast on deck, her spliced mainmast tottering;
she was the bedraggled wreck of a craft.</p>

<p>Beyond, the berg towered into the fog,
stretched into the fog; only a broken wall of blue-white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
ice was visible. The butt of the bowsprit
overhung a wide ledge. To scramble to the
shattered extremity, to hang by the hands, to
drop to safe foothold: this would all have been
easy for children. The impulse was to seek the
solid berg in haste before the schooner had time
to fall away and sink.</p>

<p>Robinson ran forward.</p>

<p>"Got that kid?" Skipper Libe demanded.
"Ah, you has! Billy Topsail!" he roared.</p>

<p>Billy answered.</p>

<p>"Get ashore on that ice!" the skipper ordered.</p>

<p>Billy ran out on the broken bowsprit and
dropped to the berg. He looked back expectantly.</p>

<p>"Take the kid!"</p>

<p>A push sent Robinson on the same road. He
dropped Mary into Billy's waiting arms. Then
he, too, looked back for orders.</p>

<p>"Ashore with you!"</p>

<p>Robinson swung by the hands and dropped.
Before he let go his hands he had felt the vessel
quiver and begin to recede from her position.</p>

<p>"Now, men," said the skipper, "grub! She'll
be off in a minute."</p>

<p>Every man of them leaped willingly to the imperative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
duty. The food was in the forecastle and
hold; they disappeared. Skipper Libe kept
watch on deck. With the waves restless beneath
her stern, the schooner was perilously insecure.
She was gradually working her way back to the
sea. The briefest glance below had already assured
Skipper Libe that her timbers were hopelessly
sprung.</p>

<p>She was old&mdash;rotten with age and hard service.
The water was pouring in forward and amidships;
it ran aft in a flood, contributing its weight to the
vessel's inclination to slip away from the berg.
It was slow in the beginning, this retreat; but
through every moment the movement was accelerated.
Five minutes&mdash;four&mdash;three: in a space
too brief to be counted upon she would be wallowing
in the sea.</p>

<p>"Haste!" the skipper screamed.</p>

<p>Waiting was out of the question. The <i>Fish
Killer</i> was about to drop into the sea. Though
the men had but tumbled into the forecastle&mdash;though
as yet they had had no time to seize the
food of which to-morrow would find them in desperate
need&mdash;the skipper roared the order to return.</p>

<p>"Ashore! Ashore!" he shouted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>They came back more willingly, more expeditiously,
than they had gone; and they came back
empty-handed. Not a man among them had so
much as a single biscuit.</p>

<p>"Jim!" said the skipper.</p>

<p>With that, Jim Tall, the cook, clambered out on
the bowsprit. The others of the crew waited,
each with an anxious eye upon the skipper.</p>

<p>"Bill!"</p>

<p>No sooner was Jim Tall at the end of the bowsprit
than Bill was underway. The skipper
grimly watched his terrified progress.</p>

<p>"Jack!"</p>

<p>In turn, Jack Sop scrambled out and dropped
to the berg. The schooner was fast receding
from the ledge. Alexander Budge, John Swan,
Archibald Mann, completing the fishing crew,
with the exception of Tom Watt, the first hand,
and the skipper, won the ice.</p>

<p>"Now, Tom!" said the skipper.</p>

<p>"You, sir!"</p>

<p>"Tom!" Skipper Libe roared; and you may be
sure that Tom Watt waited no longer.</p>

<p>Only the skipper was left. The change from
his passive attitude&mdash;from his unbending, reposeful
attitude, with a hand carelessly laid on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
windlass&mdash;was so sudden and unequivocal that
Jim Tall, the cook, who was ever the wag of the
crew, startled even himself with laughter. It was
instant. Skipper Libe in a flash turned from a
petrified man into a terrified and marvellously
agile monkey. He bounded for the bowsprit,
nimbly ran the broken length of it, and there
stood swaying. The vessel was now so far from
the ledge, and so fast receding, that he paused.
Delay had but one issue. This was so apparent
that horror tied the tongues of the crew. Not a
cry of warning was uttered. The situation was
too intense, too brief, for utterance.</p>

<p>"Tom," said the skipper to the first hand,
"catch!"</p>

<p>He leaped.</p>

<p>"Skipper," said Tom Watt, in the uttermost
confusion, an instant later, "glad t' see you!
Come in! You isn't a minute too early."</p>

<p>In this way, proceeding with admirable self-possession,
the souls aboard the <i>Fish Killer</i>
jumped from the frying-pan. Whether or not it
was into the fire was not for a moment in doubt.
When the schooner had once fairly reached the
sea, which immediately happened, she sank.
They saw her waver, slowly settle, disappear;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
when her topmast went tottering under water the
end had come.</p>

<p>Whatever may be said of a frying-pan, nobody
can accuse the crew of the <i>Fish Killer</i> of having
come within reach of a fire. Aboard the berg it
was cold&mdash;awfully cold. Icebergs carry an atmosphere
of that sort even into the Gulf Stream;
they radiate cold so effectively that the captains
of steamers take warning and evade them. It
was cold&mdash;very, very cold. There was nothing
to temper the numbing bitterness of the situation.
And what the night might bring could
only be surmised.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Though they were born to lives of hardship
and peril, though they had long been used to the
chances of the sea, not one of the castaways had
ever before fallen into a predicament so barren of
hope. Flung on an iceberg, adrift on the wild
North Atlantic, derelict where no ships passed,
at the mercy of the capricious winds, without
food or fire: there seemed to be no possibility of
escape. But for a time they did not despair;
and, moreover, for a time each felt it a high duty
to make light of the situation, to joke of cold-storage
and polar bears, that the spirits of the others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
might be encouraged. As dusk approached,
however, the ghastly humour failed. Ruin, agony,
grief, imminent death; in the moody silence, they
dwelt, rather, upon these things.</p>

<p>It was not yet dark when a faint shock, a hardly
perceptible shiver, a crash from aloft, a subsiding
rumble, apprised the castaways of a portentous
change of condition.</p>

<p>"What's that, now?" growled the cook.</p>

<p>It was a cruelly anxious moment. Only the
event itself would determine whether or not the
berg was to turn turtle. They waited.</p>

<p>"She's grounded, I 'low!" exclaimed the
skipper.</p>

<p>There was no further disturbance. Whatever
had happened, the equilibrium of the berg had
been maintained.</p>

<p>"I'm thinkin'," said the skipper, "that I'll
take a little look about."</p>

<p>The skipper's "little look about" developed
what appeared to be a saving opportunity. The
berg had grounded; it had also jammed a wandering
pack of drift-ice against the land. What
that shore was, whether mainland or island, the
skipper did not wait to ascertain; it was sufficient
for him to know that the survivors of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
<i>Fish Killer</i> might escape from a disintegrating
berg to solid ground.</p>

<p>He returned, breathless, with the enlivening
news; and in lively fashion, which almost approached
a panic, the castaways abandoned the
berg. It was a hard, painful, dangerous scramble,
made in the failing light, and the cook had
an unwelcome bath in the icy water between two
pans; but it had a successful issue. Before dark,
they were all ashore&mdash;more hopeful, now, than
they had been, but still staring death in the
face.</p>

<p>So curious was Skipper Libe that, taking advantage
of the last of the light, he set out to discover
the character of the refuge. He returned
discouraged.</p>

<p>"'Tis but a rock," said he. "'Tis no more
than a speck o' land."</p>

<p>Then night fell. Robinson's little daughter
was by this time on the point of succumbing to
the exposure. Cold, hunger and despair had
reduced her to a pitiable silence. She was in
the extremity of physical exhaustion. They
made a deep hollow in the snow in the shelter of
a declivity of rock; and there they bestowed
her, gladly yielding their jackets to provide her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
with such comfort as they could. But this was
small mitigation of the hardship. The child was
still hopeless and cold. It was sadly apparent
that she could not survive the night. And Robinson
knew that to-morrow and to-morrow&mdash;a
long stretch of days&mdash;lay before them all. There
was no hope for a frail body; weakness was
death. In his heart he frankly admitted that he
was about to lose his child.</p>

<p>He lay down beside her. "Mary, dear," he
pleaded, "don't give up!"</p>

<p>She pressed his hand.</p>

<p>"Don't give up!" he repeated.</p>

<p>A wan smile came and went. "I can't help
it," she whispered.</p>

<p>Skipper Libe and his men withdrew. It was
now near midnight. The fog was lifting. Stars
twinkled in patches of black sky. Low towards
the seaward horizon the moon was breaking
through the clouds.</p>

<p>Suddenly the cook sat bolt upright. "Skipper,"
he demanded, "where is we?"</p>

<p>"On the Devil's Teeth."</p>

<p>"An' what rock's this?"</p>

<p>"This?"</p>

<p>"Ay&mdash;<em>this!</em>"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'd not be s'prised," the skipper answered,
"if 'tis what they calls the Cocked Hat."</p>

<p>"Feather's Folly!" roared the cook.</p>

<p>"Which?" said the skipper, suspiciously.</p>

<p>The cook was on his feet&mdash;dancing in glad
excitement. "Feather's Folly!" he shouted
"Feather's Folly!"</p>

<p>"Catch un!" said the skipper, quietly. "He've
gone mad."</p>

<p>They set upon the poor cook. Before he could
escape they had him fast. He was tripped,
thrown, sat upon.</p>

<p>"Don't let him up," the skipper warned.
"He'll do hisself hurt. Poor man!" he sighed.
"He've lost his senses."</p>

<p>"Mad!" screamed the cook. "<em>You're</em> mad.
Feather's Folly! We're saved!"</p>

<p>"Hold un tight," said the skipper.</p>

<p>But the cook was not to be held. He wriggled
free and bolted. Billy Topsail and all took after
him, the skipper in the lead; and by the dim,
changing light of that night he led them a mad
chase over rock and through drifted snow. They
pursued, they headed him off, they laid hold of
his flying coat-tail; but he eluded them, dodged,
sped, doubled. If he were mad, there was method<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
in his madness. He was searching every square
yard of that acre of uneven rock. At last, panting
and perspiring, he came to a full stop and
turned triumphantly upon his pursuers. He had
found what he sought.</p>

<p>"Mad!" he laughed. "Who's mad, now?
Eh? Who's crazy?"</p>

<p>The crew stared.</p>

<p>"Who's crazy?" the cook roared. "Look at
that! What d'ye make o' that?"</p>

<p>"It looks," the skipper admitted, "like salvation!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Old man Feather had indeed "seen that it
wouldn't happen again." He had provided for
castaways on the Cocked Hat. There was a
tight little hut in the lee of the Bishop's Nose;
within, there were provisions and blankets and
fire-wood and candles. Moreover, in the sprawling,
misspelled welcome, tacked to the wall, there
was even the heartening information that "seegars
is in the kityun tabl." The passengers and
crew of the <i>Fish Killer</i> were soon warm and satisfied.
They spent a happy night&mdash;a night so
changed, so cozy, so bountiful, that they blessed
old man Feather until their tongues were tired.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
And old man Feather, himself, who kept watch
on the Cocked Hat with a spy-glass, took them
off to Hulk's Harbour in the clear weather of the
next day.</p>

<p>"An' did you find the cigars, skipper?" he
whispered, with a wide, proud grin.</p>

<p>"Us did."</p>

<p>"An' was they good? Hist! now," the old
fellow repeated, with a wink of mystery, "<em>wasn't</em>
they good?"</p>

<p>"Well," the skipper drawled, not ungraciously,
you may be sure, "the cook made bad weather
of it. But he double-reefed hisself an' lived
through. 'Twas the finest an' the first cigar he
ever seed."</p>

<p>The old man chuckled delightedly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<div class='summary'><i>In Which the Clerk of the Trader Tax Yarns
of a Madman in the Cabin</i></div>


<div class='drop-cap'>THE trading-schooner <i>Tax</i> of Ruddy Cove
had come down from the Labrador. She
was riding at anchor in the home harbour,
with her hold full of salt fish and the goods
in her cabin run sadly low. Billy Topsail, safely
back from Feather's Folly, and doomed by the
wreck of the <i>Fish Killer</i> to spend the summer in
the quieter pursuits of Ruddy Cove, had gone
aboard to greet the crew. There was hot tea on
the forecastle table, and the crew was yarning to
a jolly, brown grinning lot of Ruddy folk, who
had come aboard. It was Cook, the clerk, a
merry, blue-eyed little man, who told the story of
the madman in the cabin.</div>

<p>"We were lying in Shelter Harbour," said he,
"waiting for a fair wind to Point-o'-Bay. It
was coming close to night when they saw
him leaping along shore and kicking a tin kettle
as though 'twas a football. I was in the cabin,
putting the stock to rights after the day's trade.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
I heard the hail and the skipper's answering, 'Ay
ay! This is the trader <i>Tax</i> from Ruddy Cove.'
Then the skipper sung out to know if I wanted a
customer. Customer? To be sure I wanted
one!</p>

<p>"'If he has a gallon of oil or a pound of fish,'
said I, 'fetch him aboard.'</p>

<p>"'He looks queer,' said the skipper.</p>

<p>"'Queer he may look,' said I, 'and queer he
may be, but his fish will be first cousins to the
ones in the hold, and I'll barter for them.'</p>

<p>"With that the skipper put off in the punt to
fetch the customer; but when he drew near shore
he lay on his oars, something puzzled, I'm thinking,
for the customer was dancing a hornpipe on
a flat rock at the water's edge, by the first light of
the moon.</p>

<p>"'Have you got a fish t' trade?' said the skipper.</p>

<p>"'Good-evenin', skipper, sir,' said the queer
customer, after a last kick and flourish. 'I've a
quintal or two an' a cask o' oil that I'm wantin'
bad t' trade away.'</p>

<p>"He was rational as you please; so the skipper
was thrown off his guard, took him aboard,
and pulled out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>"'You're quite a dancer,' said he.</p>

<p>"'Hut!' said the man. 'That's nothin' at all.
When the moon's full an' high, sir, I dances over
the waves; an' when they's a gale blowin' I goes
aloft t' the clouds an' shakes a foot up there.'</p>

<p>"'Do you, now?' said the skipper, not knowing
whether to take this in joke or earnest.</p>

<p>"'Believe <em>me</em>, sir,' said the man, with the
gravest of faces, 'I'm a wonderful dancer.'</p>

<p>"I was on deck when they came aboard. It
was then dusk. I noticed nothing out of the ordinary
in my customer's appearance. He was a
large, big-boned man, well supplied with fat and
muscle, and capable, as I thought at the moment,
of enduring all the toil and hardship to which the
men of that coast are exposed. The skipper
handed him over to me without a word of warning,
and went below to the forecastle, for the wind
was blowing cold and misty."</p>

<p>"Oh, well," the skipper broke in from his place
in a bunk, "how could I tell that he was mad?"</p>

<p>"Whatever, Skipper Job," the clerk resumed,
with a twinkle in his eye, "I took him into the
cabin, and the crew and you were snug enough
in the forecastle, where no hail of mine could reach
you. It was not until then," he resumed, "when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
the light of the cabin lamp fell full upon him, that
I had a proper appreciation of my customer's
size and strength&mdash;not until then that I marked
the deathly pallour of his face and the strange light
in his eyes. He was frowsy, dirty, dressed in
ragged moleskin cloth; and he had a habit of
looking to right and left and aloft&mdash;anywhere, it
appeared, but straight in my face&mdash;so that I
caught no more than a red flash from his eyes
from time to time. I felt uneasy, without being
able to account to myself for the feeling; so,
anxious to be well rid of him, I asked, abruptly,
in what I could serve him.</p>

<p>"'I'm thinkin' you'll not be havin' the thing I
wants,' said he.</p>

<p>"That touched me on a tender spot. 'I'm
thinking,' said I, 'that we've a little of all that
you ever thought of.'</p>

<p>"'I don't think you has,' said he, 'but 'twould
be best for you if you had.'</p>

<p>"There was a hidden meaning in that. Why
should it be best for me?</p>

<p>"'And what is it?' said I.</p>

<p>"''Tis a spool o' silk thread,' said he, soberly,
't' bind the fairies with&mdash;the wicked fairies that
tells me t' do the things I don't want t'. If you've<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
any o' <em>that</em>, sir, I'll take all you got aboard, for I
wants it bad.'</p>

<p>"'Come, now, my man,' said I sharply, 'stop
your joking. I'm tired, and in no humour for it.
What is it you want?'</p>

<p>"'I'm not jokin', sir,' said he. 'I wants a
spool o' green silk thread t' lash the wicked
fairies t' the spruce trees.'</p>

<p>"I could not doubt him longer; there was too
much longing, too much hopelessness, in his voice
for that. He was demented; but there are many
men of that coast whom lonely toil has driven
mad, but yet who live their lives through to the
natural end, peaceable folk and good fishermen,
and I thought that this poor fellow had as good
a right to trade with me as the sanest man in
Shelter Harbour.</p>

<p>"'We've no green silk thread, sir,' said I, 'that
will securely lash fairies to spruce trees. But if
you want anything else, and have fish to trade,
I'll take them.'</p>

<p>"'I wisht you had the thread,' said he.</p>

<p>"'Why?' said I.</p>

<p>"''Twould be best for you,' said he with a
sigh. 'If I could tie the wicked fairies up, I
wouldn't have t'&mdash;have t'&mdash;do it. But,' he went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
on, 'as you haven't any thread, I'll take some
calico t' make a new dress for my brother's little
maid.'</p>

<p>"A certain look of cunning, which overspread
his face at that moment, alarmed me. I thought
I had better find out what the wicked fairies had
to do with me.</p>

<p>"'Did you meet the fairies to-night?' said I.</p>

<p>"'Ay,' said he. 'I met the crew o' wicked
ones on my way through the bush.'</p>

<p>"'And what did they tell you?' said I.</p>

<p>"He signed to me to be silent; then he closed
the cabin door and came close to the counter, behind
which I stood, with no way of escape open.</p>

<p>"'Has you got a loaded gun?' he whispered
hoarsely.</p>

<p>"His face was close to mine. In his eyes,
which were now steady, two live, red coals were
glowing. I fell back from him, frightened; for
I now knew what work the wicked fairies had
assigned to him for that night. Poor fellow!
Frightened though I was, I pitied him. I saw
his distress, and pitied him! He was fighting
manfully against the impulse; but it mastered
him, at last, and I realized that my life was in
grave danger. I was penned in, you know, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>&mdash;they
call me 'little Cook'&mdash;I was no match
for him.</p>

<p>"'No,' said I. 'I've no gun.'</p>

<p>"'Has you got a knife?' said he.</p>

<p>"'Sorry,' said I; 'but I'm sold out of knives.'</p>

<p>"'Has you got a razor?' said he.</p>

<p>"It was high time to mislead him. I saw an
opportunity to escape.</p>

<p>"'Is it razors you want?' I cried. 'Sure, I've
some grand ones&mdash;big ones, boy, sharp ones,
bright ones. I keep them in the forecastle where
'tis dry. So I'll just run up to fetch the lot to
show you.'</p>

<p>"His eyes glistened when I spoke of the brightness
and sharpness of those razors. With a show
of confidence, I jumped on the counter and
swung my legs over. But he pushed me back&mdash;so
angrily, indeed, that I feared to precipitate the
encounter if I persisted.</p>

<p>"'Don't trouble, sir,' said he. 'I'll find something
that'll answer. Ha!' said he, taking an
axe from the rack and 'hefting' it. 'This will do.'</p>

<p>"'But I'm wanting to wash my hands, anyway,'
said I.</p>

<p>"''Twill make no difference in the end,' said
he quietly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>"I speak of it calmly now; but when I found
myself alone in the cabin with that poor madman&mdash;found
myself behind the counter, with no defensive
weapon at hand, with my life in the care
of my wits, which are neither sharp nor ready&mdash;I
was in no condition for calm thought. To hail
the skipper was out of the question; he would
not hear me, and the first shout would doubtless
excite the big man in the moleskin clothes beyond
restraint. My hope of escape lay in distracting
his attention from the matter in hand until the
skipper should come aft of his own notion. But
I made one effort in another direction.</p>

<p>"'Did you say <em>green</em> silk thread or <em>blue?</em>'
said I.</p>

<p>"'I said green, sir.'</p>

<p>"'Did you, now?' I exclaimed. 'Sure, I
thought you said blue. We've no blue, but we've
the green, and you'll be able to lash the fairies to
the spruce trees, after all.'</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact, we had a few spools of
silk thread, and one of them was green&mdash;a bad
stock, as I knew to my cost, for I had long been
trying to dispose of them.</p>

<p>"''Tis too late,' said he.</p>

<p>"'No, no!' said I. 'You'll surely not be letting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
the fairies drive you like that. You can take the
green thread and lash them all up on the way
home.'</p>

<p>"'No,' he said doggedly; ''tis too late. What
they told me to do I must do before the clock
strikes.'</p>

<p>"'Strikes what?' said I.</p>

<p>"'Twelve,' said he.</p>

<p>"With what relief did I hear this! Twelve
o'clock? It was now but eight. The skipper
would come aft long before that hour.</p>

<p>"''Tis a long time to wait,' said I. 'I'll make
up my bunk, and you may lie down a bit and
rest.'</p>

<p>"'It lacks but twelve minutes of the hour,'
said he. 'They's a clock hangin' behind you,
sir.'</p>

<p>"He indicated a cheap American alarm clock.
It was the last of a half dozen I had kept hanging
from the roof of the cabin. I had kept them
wound up, for the mere pleasure of hearing their
busy ticking, but had never set them&mdash;never
troubled to keep them running to the right time.
When I looked up I was dismayed to find that
the clock pointed to twelve minutes to twelve
o'clock!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>"''Tis not the right time,' I began. ''Tis far
too&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'Hist!' said he. 'Don't speak. You've but
eleven minutes left.'</p>

<p>"Thus we stood, the fisherman with his back
to the door and the axe in his hand, and myself
behind the counter, while the cheap American
alarm clock ticked off the minutes of my life.
Eleven&mdash;ten&mdash;nine! They were fast flying. I
could think of no plan to dissuade him&mdash;no ruse
to outwit him. Indeed, my mind was occupied
more with putting the blame on that lying clock
than with anything else. I had determined, of
course, to make the best fight I could&mdash;to blow
out the light at the moment of attack, dive under
the counter, catch my man by the legs, overturn
him and escape by the door or there fight it out.
Nine minutes&mdash;eight&mdash;seven! At that moment
I caught a long hail from the shore.</p>

<p>"'Schooner ahoy! Ahoy!'</p>

<p>"I do not think the fisherman heard it. It
was too faint&mdash;too far off; and he was too intent
upon the thing he was to do.</p>

<p>"'Six minutes, sir,' said he.</p>

<p>"I wondered if Job had heard. The hail was
repeated. Then I heard Skipper Job answer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
from the deck. At that the fisherman started;
but his alarm passed in a moment.</p>

<p>"'Ahoy!' shouted Skipper Job.</p>

<p>"'Has you got a strange man aboard?' came
from the shore.</p>

<p>"'Yes, sir,' Job called.</p>

<p>"'Watch him,' from the shore. 'He's mad.'</p>

<p>"'Oh, he's all right,' Job called. 'He's harmless.'</p>

<p>"Then silence. My hope of relief vanished.
I should have to make the fight, after all, I
thought.</p>

<p>"'Five minutes, sir,' said the madman.</p>

<p>"Had Skipper Job gone below again? Or
would he come aft? For two minutes not a word
was said. My customer and I were waiting for
the first stroke of twelve. Soon I heard voices
forward; then the tramp of feet coming aft over
the deck&mdash;treading softly. They paused by the
house, and the whispering ceased. Was it a
rescue, or was it not? I could not tell. The men
above seemed to have no concern with me. But,
indeed, they had.</p>

<p>"'John, b'y,' a strange voice called, 'is you
below?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>"''Tis me brother Timothy,' my customer
whispered. 'I must be goin' home.'</p>

<p>"'John, b'y, is you below?'</p>

<p>"'Ay, Timothy!'</p>

<p>"'Come up, b'y. I'm goin' ashore now, an'
'tis time you was in bed.'</p>

<p>"My customer put up the axe, and, with a sign
to me to keep silence, went on deck, with me following.
He jumped in the punt, as docile as a
child, gave us all good-night, and was rowed
ashore. We did not see him again; for the wind
blew fresh from the nor'west in the morning, and
by night we were anchored at Point-o'-Bay.
Whether or not the fairies had commanded the
poor fellow to kill me at twelve o'clock, I do not
know. He did not say so; but I think they
had."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<div class='summary'><i>In Which a Pirate's Cave grows Interesting, and
Two Young Members of the Ethnological and
Antiquarian Club of St. John's, Undertake an
Adventure under the Guidance of Billy Topsail</i></div>


<div class='drop-cap'>THERE landed in Ruddy Cove, that summer,
two youngsters from St. John's on a
vacation&mdash;city schoolboys both: not fisher
lads. They were pleasant fellows, and were
soon fast friends with Billy Topsail and the lads of
the place, by whom they were regarded with
some awe, but still with great friendliness.</div>

<p>"Hello!" the visitors exclaimed, when they
clapped eyes on Billy. "Where you going?"</p>

<p>"Fishin'."</p>

<p>"Take us, won't you, please?"</p>

<p>Billy Topsail grinned.</p>

<p>"Won't you?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Billy. "I 'low so."</p>

<p>They went to the grounds; and the day was
blue, and the sea was quiet, and Billy Topsail and
the schoolboys had a marvellously splendid time;
so they were all friends together from that out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom Call and Jack Wither were members of
what they called, with no little pride, "The Ethnological
and Antiquarian Club of St. John's."
The object of this club of lads was, in the beginning,
to preserve relics of the exterminated
Beothuk tribe; but to the little collections of stone
implements and flint-lock guns were soon added
collections of mineral specimens, of fossils, of
stamps, of fish and shells and sea-weeds, of insects,
of old prints and documents&mdash;in short, of
everything to which an inveterate collector might
attach a value.</p>

<p>Wherever they went in the long vacation,
whether to the coast or to the interior, not one of
them but kept an eye open for additions to the
club collections; and, though much of what they
brought back had to be rejected, it was not long
before they had the gratification of observing an
occasional reference to "the collections of the
Ethnological and Antiquarian Club" in the city
newspapers.</p>

<p>All this accounts for the presence of Tom Call
and Jack Wither in the Little Tickle Basin, in
the thick of the islands off Ruddy Cove, one vacation
day, and for their interest in a rusted iron
mooring-ring, which was there sunk in the rock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>"And nobody knows who put it there?" Tom
asked, curiously fingering the old ring.</p>

<p>"No," replied Billy Topsail, who had taken
them over; "but they says 'twas the pirates put
it there, long ago."</p>

<p>"Pirates!" cried Tom. "Do they say that?"</p>

<p>"'Twas me grandfather told me so."</p>

<p>It may be that pirates harboured in the Little
Tickle Basin in the days when they made the
Caribbean Sea a fearsome place to sail upon.
When the Newfoundland coast was remote, uninhabited,
uncharted, no safer hiding place could
have been found than that quiet little basin, hidden
away among the thousand barren islands
of the bay. If, as they say, every pirate had
his place of refuge, the iron ring is some evidence,
at least, that a buccaneer was accustomed to fly
to the basin when pursuit got too persistent and
too hot for him.</p>

<p>"Of course!" said Tom, when they were sailing
back to Ruddy Cove. "How else can you
account for that ring? I bet you," he concluded,
"that dozens of pirates had dens on this coast."</p>

<p>"Now, Tom," said Jack, "you know as well as
I do that that's just a little too&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well," he interrupted, "everybody knows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
that pirates used to come here. You'll find it in
the histories. It wouldn't surprise me to learn
that there is a cave around here."</p>

<p>"There is," said Billy Topsail.</p>

<p>"There!" cried Tom, his eyes shining. "I
told you so!"</p>

<p>"'Tis a wonderful curious place, too," Billy
went on. "You has t' crawl through a hole t'
get inside. Sure, the hole is no bigger than a
scuttle. You could close it with a fair sized rock.
But once you gets through, the cave is as big as
a room. 'Twould hold a score o' men very comfortable."</p>

<p>Tom gave Jack a meaning glance. Then he
turned to Billy Topsail.</p>

<p>"Can you take us there?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know as I could. I've only <em>heered
tell</em> they was a cave like that."</p>

<p>"And you've never been there?"</p>

<p>"Not me."</p>

<p>Tom's face fell&mdash;fell so suddenly and to an expression
so woeful that Jack laughed outright,
though he sympathized with Tom's disappointment.</p>

<p>"But I knows a man that <em>has</em> been there,"
Billy continued. "He's the man that found it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
'Tis like, now, that he's the only man that's ever
been inside."</p>

<p>"Then the place isn't well known?"</p>

<p>"So far as I can tell, nobody knows it but ol'
Joe West."</p>

<p>When they ran Billy's punt to old Joe West's
stage, at Ruddy Cove, that night, Joe was inside,
splitting the day's catch of cod. They broached
the object of their visit without delay. Would
he guide them to the cave at Little Tickle Basin?
But Joe shook his head. The squid were in the
harbour, and the fish were taking the bait in
lively fashion. The loss of a day's catch was
"beyond thinkin' of."</p>

<p>"Do you know the bearings?" Tom asked.</p>

<p>"T' be sure. 'Tis very simple t' get near the
spot; but 'tis wonderful hard t' find the hole.
'Tis all overgrown. You might hunt for a year,
I'm thinkin', an' never find it. When you does find
it, it takes a deal o' nerve t' crawl in. 'Tis that dark
an' damp! You keeps thinkin' all the time, too,
that something will fall over the hole an' shut you
in. If you crawls through," Joe concluded, impressively,
"be sure one o' you stays outside."</p>

<p>"But we've no chart of the place," Tom complained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you've paper an' a bit o' pencil," said Skipper
Joe, "I'll draw you one."</p>

<p>Here is what he drew:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 312px;">
<img src="images/page213.jpg" width="312" height="250" alt="map" />
</div>

<p>Skipper Joe, of course, carefully explained his
drawing. "Does you see where the arrow
points?" said he. "Well, 'tis there. You gets
the head o' that little rock in line with the point,
at high water, an' there you are. The cliff is
rough, an' covered with a growth o' spruce.
The hole is about half way up, openin' off a
mossy ledge. You'll have t' pry around a wonderful
lot t' find it."</p>

<p>"What's it like inside?" Tom asked, eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, they is a deal o' birch bark scattered
around, an' a lot o' broken rock. I saw that by
the light of a match; but I was too scared t' stay
long, an' I haven't never been there since."</p>

<p>Billy Topsail agreed to sail the sloop to Little
Tickle Basin on the next day. Then the boys
walked home by the road, much excited. Indeed,
Tom, who was of an imaginative and enthusiastic
turn, was fairly transported. No flight of
fancy was too high for him&mdash;no hope too wild.
The chart passed from his hand to Jack's and
back again a hundred times. The crude, strange
drawing, with its significant arrow, touched all
the pirate tales with reality.</p>

<p>"If it had been only a cave, without a rusted
mooring-ring, it wouldn't have been so much,"
said Tom. "But with the ring&mdash;<em>with</em> the ring,
my boy&mdash;a narrow, hidden passage to a cave
means a great deal more."</p>

<p>Jack asked Tom what he was "driving at."</p>

<p>"I think," said he calmly, "that there is buried
treasure there."</p>

<p>Jack scoffed.</p>

<p>"Very well," said Tom; "but you must remember
that these discoveries come unexpectedly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
They're <em>stumbled</em> on. You can't expect to find a
sign-post near buried treasure."</p>

<p>That night they lay awake for a long time.
Tom and Jack were bed-fellows at Ruddy Cove.
Struck by a simple idea, Jack awoke his friend.</p>

<p>"Tom," said he, "I think we'll find something
there."</p>

<p>"Spanish gold or English?" Tom asked,
sleepily.</p>

<p>"It will be <em>something</em>," Jack replied. "Something
we want."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<div class='summary'><i>In Which There is a Landslide at Little Tickle
Basin and Something of Great Interest and
Peculiar Value is Discovered in the Cave</i></div>


<div class='drop-cap'>NOON of the next day found the three
boys at Little Tickle Basin, with the punt
moored to the mysterious ring. Many
a vessel had floated in that snug berth before, no
doubt. But whose? And what flag did they
fly? When the tide was at the full, the boys
set off across the basin in the punt; and they
were soon ashore, with the head of the little rock
in line with the point of land, as the chart
directed.</div>

<p>"Now for it!" cried Tom.</p>

<p>And up the cliff he started, Jack following,
with Billy Topsail, who was quite as deeply
stirred as they, bringing up the rear, a pick in
one hand and a shovel in the other. It was not
hard climbing. The declivity could hardly be
called a cliff. Rather, it was a hill, rising sharply
from the water's edge&mdash;steep, strewn with broken
rock, loose turf and decaying stumps, and overgrown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
with moss and ill-nourished shrubs. Jack
was impressed with the instability of the whole
mass.</p>

<p>"If it weren't for the juts of naked rock," he
thought, with some alarm, "this stuff would all
slip into the water, like snow from the roof of a
house."</p>

<p>But he was far too deeply interested in the
search to dwell upon such speculation, however
threateningly the imagination might present the
possibilities. They all kept to the perpendicular
line, from their landing place to the crest of the
hill; and they searched painstakingly, tearing
aside the shrubs, peering under overhanging
rocks, prying into dark holes. It was all without
reward. At last, Jack came to the top of the
hill. Tom was below him, following a narrow
ledge; and Billy Topsail, now wearied of the
search, was sitting on a boulder, lower down.</p>

<p>"Hello, Tom!" Jack shouted. "What luck?"</p>

<p>Jack caught hold of a shrub, and leaned outward,
in an attempt to catch sight of Tom.</p>

<p>"Nothing yet," Tom answered.</p>

<p>Then Jack's feet, which had been resting on an
insecure footing of loose stones, shot from under
him. He clung to his shrub and held his position,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
but in the effort he dislodged a small
boulder, which went crashing down, dislodging
earth and the accumulations of broken rock in
its course. He had started a little avalanche;
and the most he could do was to cry a horrified
warning and watch it go rolling down, growing
greater as it went.</p>

<p>"Tom!" he called. "Oh, Tom!"</p>

<p>This time there was no answer. Dead silence
followed the frantic call and the plunge of the
avalanche into the water. What had become of
Tom? Billy Topsail, who had found shelter in
the "lee" of the boulder upon which he had been
sitting, suggested, when Jack joined him, that
Tom had been swept into the water by the flood
of stones and earth. Jack scouted the suggestion.
Had he not watched the course of that selfsame
flood? Tom had been on the ledge. He must
still be there&mdash;unconscious, probably, and unable
to answer to the call of his name.</p>

<p>"We'll look there first, at any rate," he determined.</p>

<p>A great part of the avalanche had lodged on
the ledge. Stones and moss and new earth lay
in slanting heaps in many places; but of Tom's
body there was no sign.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>"He've been swep' into the water, I fears,"
Billy declared.</p>

<p>"Or buried on the ledge," said Jack.</p>

<p>Jack called to his friend again. While they
listened, straining their ears for the remotest
response, he had his eye fixed on a remnant
of the avalanche near by. To his unbounded
astonishment, he perceived evidences of some
disturbance within the heap. The disturbance
suddenly developed into an upheaval. A foot
and an ankle shot out. A moment later Billy
Topsail had that foot and its mate in his hands
and was hauling with small regard for the body
behind.</p>

<p>It was Tom.</p>

<p>"I've found the cave!" he gasped, when they
had set him on his feet, profusely perspiring,
flushed and exceedingly dirty. "But what's up?
How did I get shut in there? Part of the hill
slipped away! I <em>thought</em> it was a landslide. I
found the hole, and started to crawl in, to make
sure that it was the place before I said anything.
Then I heard a racket; and then the light was shut
out. I thought I might as well go on, though, and
find out afterwards what had happened. So on
I went. And it's the cave, boy!" he cried.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
"When I made sure of that," he went on, "I
wanted to get out in a hurry. I was afraid to
crawl into that hole head foremost&mdash;afraid of
being jammed. Of course, I knew that something
had fallen over the mouth of it; and I
thought I could kick the thing out of the way
just as easily as I could push it, and meantime
have all the air there was. So out I came, feet
first. Have you got that pick and shovel, Billy?
Let's clear this stuff away from the hole and
go in."</p>

<p>"What's in there, Tom?" Jack asked.</p>

<p>"You'll soon find out."</p>

<p>They left Billy Topsail outside, as a precaution
against entombment. Tom went first with the
lantern. When, looking along the passage, Jack
saw a flare of light, he followed. The passage
was about six feet long, and so narrow that
he could not quite go upon hands and knees.
He squirmed through, with his heart in his
mouth, and found himself, at last, in a roomy
chamber, apparently rough-hewn, wherein Tom
was dancing about like a wild Indian.</p>

<p>"Pirate gold!" he shouted. "Pirate gold!"</p>

<p>"Where is it?" Jack cried, believing, for the
moment, that he had discovered it in sacks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dig, boy!" said Tom. "It's underground."</p>

<p>At any rate, a glance about, by the light of the
lantern, discovered no treasure. It was underground,
if it were anywhere. So they set about
unearthing it without delay. But there was no
earth&mdash;nothing but broken rock. The shovel
was of small use; they took turns with the pick,
labouring hard and excitedly, expecting, momentarily,
to catch the glitter of gold. Occasionally,
the strength of both was needed to lift
some great, obstinate stone out of the way; but,
for the most part, while one wielded the pick, the
other removed the loosened rock.</p>

<p>"What in the world is this thing?" Tom
asked.</p>

<p>He had taken a round, brown object from the
excavation. Suddenly he let it drop, with a little
cry of horror, and started to his feet. Jack
picked it up and held it close to the lantern.</p>

<p>"Pirates!" whispered Tom, now utterly horrified.</p>

<p>"Last night," said Jack, "I told you that we'd
find <em>something</em>. We've found it."</p>

<p>"We've found a pirates' den," said Tom.</p>

<p>"No," Jack replied, handing him the skull;
"we've found a Beothuk Indian burial cave.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
We've struck it rich for the Ethnological and
Antiquarian Club!"</p>

<p>"Well," Tom admitted, ruefully, "that's <em>something!</em>"</p>

<p>Struck it rich? Indeed, they had! The most
valuable part of the collection of Indian relics,
now in the club's museum, came from that cave.
The excavation occupied three days; and at the
end of it, when they laid their treasures out at
Ruddy Cove, they were thrown into a transport
of delight. In addition to the skeleton remains,
which have since served a highly useful purpose,
they had found stone hatchets, knives, spearheads,
clubs, and various other implements of
warfare and the hunt; three clay masks, a curious
clay figure in human form, and three complete
specimens of Indian pottery, with a number
of fragments.</p>

<p>The rusted iron mooring-ring has never been
explained.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<div class='summary'><i>In Which Billy Topsail Determines to go to the
Ice in the Spring of the Year and Young
Archibald Armstrong of St. John's is Permitted
to Set Out Upon an Adventure Which Promises
to be Perilous but Profitable</i></div>


<div class='drop-cap'>IN the winter when he was fifteen years old,
Billy Topsail determined to go to the ice with
the great sealing fleet in the spring, if it
could be managed by hook or crook. His father
had no objection to make. The boy was
old enough to look out for himself, he knew;
and he was sure that the experience would complete
the process of making a man of him.</div>

<p>"Go, b'y," said he, "if you can."</p>

<p>There was the difficulty. What sealing captain
would take a lad of fifteen when there were
grown men to be shipped? Billy was at a loss.
But he determined, nevertheless, that he would
go to the ice, and selected Long Tom Harbour
as a promising port to sail from, for it was near
by and well known. From Long Tom Harbour
then, he would go seal hunting in the spring of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
the year if it could be managed by a boy with
courage and no little ingenuity.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll go <em>somehow!</em>" said he.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was twilight of a blustering February day.
Sir Archibald Armstrong, the great St. John's
merchant, sat alone in his office, with his chair
drawn close to the low, broad window, which
overlooked the wharves and the ice-strewn
harbour beyond; and while the fire roared and
the wind drove the snow against the panes, he
lost himself in profound meditation. He stared
absently at the swarm of busy men&mdash;now almost
hidden in the dusk and storm&mdash;and at the lights
of the sealing fleet, which lay there fitting out
for the spring voyage to the drift-ice of the
north; but no sound of the activity on deck or
dock could disturb the quiet of the little office
where the fire blazed and crackled and the snow
fell softly against the window panes.</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, sir," a clerk interrupted, putting
his head in at the door. "Cap'n Hand, sir."</p>

<p>Captain Hand, of the sealing ship <i>Dictator</i>,
was admitted. He was a thick, stubby, hammer-fisted,
fiery-faced old man, marked with the mark
of the sea. His eyebrows made one broad black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
band of wiry hair, stretching from temple to temple,
where they grew in the fashion of two sharp
little horns; and he had a habit of dropping them
over his little red eyes, as if in a passion&mdash;but nobody
was deceived by that; for, save in moments
of righteous anger, the light of good humour still
shone in the little red eyes, however fiercely they
flashed. The rest of his face was beard&mdash;a wilderness
of gray beard; it sprang from somewhere
below his shirt collar, and straggled in a tangled
growth over his cheek-bones and neck.</p>

<p>"Report t' you, sir," said he, in a surprisingly
gruff voice; and at the same time he pulled the
lobe of his right ear, which was his invariable
manner of salute.</p>

<p>Sir Archibald and Captain Hand were in close
consultation for half an hour; during all of which
time the burly captain's eyes were thickly
screened by his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Oh, I sees, sir&mdash;I sees," said he, rising, at the
end of it. "Oh, ay! Of course, sir&mdash;of course!"</p>

<p>"And you'll take good care?" Sir Archibald
began, almost tenderly.</p>

<p>"Oh, ay!" heartily. "I ain't no nurse, as I
tells you fair; but you needn't worry about <em>him</em>,
sir."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>"His mother will be anxious. She'll hold you
responsible, captain."</p>

<p>Captain Hand violently pulled the lobe of his
right ear, and turned to go. At the door he
halted. "Tim Tuttle o' Raggles Island has
turned up again, sir," he said, "an' wants t' be
shipped."</p>

<p>"Tuttle?" muttered Sir Archibald. "He's
the man who led the mutiny on the <i>Never Say
Die</i>. Well, as you will, captain."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll ship him!" said the captain, grimly;
and with a last pull at his ear he disappeared.</p>

<p>On the heels of the captain's departure came
Archie. He was Sir Archibald's son; there was
no doubt about that: a fine, hardy lad&mdash;robust,
as every young Newfoundlander should be;
straight, agile, alert, with head carried high;
merry, quick-minded, ready-tongued, fearless in
wind and high sea. His hair was tawny, his
eyes blue and wide and clear, his face broad and
good humoured. All this appeared as he pulled
off his cap, threw back the flaps of his fur-lined
overcoat, picked a stray thread from his knickerbockers,
and, at last, eagerly approached his
father.</p>

<p>"You little dandy!" laughed his father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>Archie laughed, too&mdash;and flushed. He knew
that his father liked to poke fun at him because
the cut of his coat, the knot in his cravat, the
polish on his boots, were matters of such deep
concern to the boy.</p>

<p>"Oh, come now, father!" he protested. "Tell
me whether I'm to go or not."</p>

<p>For reply, Sir Archibald gravely led his son to
the window. It was his purpose to impress the
boy with the wealth and power (and, therefore,
with the responsibilities) of the firm of Armstrong
and Son.</p>

<p>"Come," said he; "let us watch them fitting
out the fleet."</p>

<p>The wealth of the firm was vast, the power
great. Directly or indirectly, Sir Archibald's
business interests touched every port in Newfoundland,
every cove of the Labrador, the markets
of Spain and Portugal, of the West Indies
and South American Republics. His fishing-schooners
went south to the Banks and north
to the gray, cold seas off Cape Chidley; the
whalers gave chase in the waters of the Gulf and
of the Straits; the traders ran from port to port
of all that rugged coast; the barques carried cod
and salmon and oil to all the markets of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
world. And when the ice came drifting down in
the spring, the sealers scattered themselves over
the waters of the North Atlantic.</p>

<p>Archie looked into the dusk without, where lay
the ships and wharves and warehouses that told
the story.</p>

<p>"They are mine," said Sir Archibald, gravely,
looking deep into his son's wide-opened eyes.
"Some day&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Archie was alarmed. What did it all mean?
Why was his father so grave? Why had he
boasted of his wealth?</p>

<p>"They will be yours," Sir Archibald concluded.
After a pause, he continued: "The firm has had
an honourable career through three generations of
our family. My father gave it to me with a spotless
reputation. More than that, with the business
he gave me the perfect faith of every man,
woman and child of the outports. The firm has
dealt with its fishermen and sealers as man with
man; it has never wronged, or oppressed, or despised
them. You are now fifteen years old. In
September, you are going to an English public
school, and thence to an English university.
You will meet with new ideals. The warehouses
and ships, the fish and fat, will not mean so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
to you. You will forget. It may be, even&mdash;for
you are something of a dandy, you know&mdash;that
you will be ashamed to acknowledge that
your father is a dealer in fish and seal-oil;
that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Archie drew breath to speak.</p>

<p>"But I want you <em>to remember</em>," Sir Archibald
went on, lifting his hand. "I want you to know a
man when you meet one, whatever the clothes
he wears. The men upon whom the fortunes of
this firm are founded are true men. They are
strong, and brave, and true. Their work is toilsome
and perilous, and their lives are not unused
to deprivation; but they are cheerful, and independent,
and fearless, through it all&mdash;stout hearts,
every one of them! They deserve respectful and
generous treatment at the hands of their employers.
For that reason I want you to know
them more intimately&mdash;to know them as shipmates
know one another&mdash;that you may be in
sympathy with them. I am confident that you
will respect them, because I know that you love
all manly qualities. And so, for your good, and
for their good, and for the good of the firm, I
have decided that you may&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That I may go?" Archie cried, eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>"With Captain Hand, of the <i>Dictator</i>, which
puts out from Long Tom Harbour at midnight
of March tenth."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<div class='summary'><i>While Billy Topsail is About His Own Business
Archie Armstrong Stands on the Bridge of the
Dictator and Captain Hand Orders "Full Speed
Ahead!" on the Stroke of Twelve.</i></div>


<div class='drop-cap'>AND so it came to pass that, at near midnight
of the tenth of March, Archie Armstrong,
warmly clad in furs, and fairly on
fire with excitement, was aboard the staunch old
sealer, at Long Tom, half way up the east coast.
It was blowing half a gale from the open sea,
which lay, hidden by the night, just beyond the
harbour rocks. The wind was stinging cold, as
though it had swept over immense areas of ice,
dragging the sluggish fields after it. It howled
aloft, rattled over the decks, and flung the smoke
from the funnel into the darkness inland. Archie
breasted it with the captain and the mate on the
bridge; and he was impatient as they to be
off from the sheltered water, fairly started in the
race for the north, though a great gale was to be
weathered.</div>

<p>"Good-bye, Skipper John," he had said to
John Roth, with whom he had spent the three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
days of waiting in this small outport. "I'll send
you two white-coats (young seals) for Aunt
Mary's sitting room, when I get back."</p>

<p>"I be past me labour, b'y," replied John, who
was, indeed, now beyond all part in the great
spring harvest, "but I'll give you the toast o'
the old days. 'Red decks, an' many o' them!'"</p>

<p>"Red decks," cried Archie, quoting the old
proverb, "make happy homes."</p>

<p>"'Tis that," said old John, striking the ground
with his staff. "An' I wish I was goin' along
with you, b'y. There's no sealin' skipper like
Cap'n Hand."</p>

<p>The ship was now hanging off shore, with
steam up and the anchor snugly stowed. Not
before the stroke of twelve of that night was it
permitted by the law to clear from Long Tom.
Fair play was thus assured to all, and the
young seals were protected from an untimely attack.
It was a race from all the outports to the
ice, with the promise of cargoes of fat to stiffen
courage and put a will for work in the hearts of
men: for a good catch, in its deeper meaning, is
like a bounteous harvest; and what it brings to
the wives and little folk in all the cottages of that
cruel coast is worth the hardship and peril.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's the time, Mr. Ackell?" said the captain
to the mate, impatiently.</p>

<p>"Lacks forty-three minutes o' the hour, sir,"
was the reply.</p>

<p>"Huh!" growled the captain. "'Tis wonderful
long in passin'."</p>

<p>"The whole harbour must be down to see the
start," Archie observed looking to the shore.</p>

<p>"More nor that, b'y," said the captain. "I've
got a Green Bay crew. Most two hundred men
o' them, an' every last one o' them a mighty
man. They's folk here from all the harbours o'
the bay t' see us off. Hark t' the guns they're
firin'!"</p>

<p>All the folk left in Long Tom&mdash;the women and
children and old men&mdash;were at the water-side; with
additions from Morton's Harbour, Burnt Bay, Exploits
and Fortune Harbour. Sailing day for the
sealers! It was the great event of the year.
Torches flared on the flakes and at the stages all
around the harbour. The cottages were all illuminated
with tallow candles. Guns were discharged
in salute. "God speed!" was shouted
from shore to ship; and you may be sure that the
crew was not slow to return the good wishes.
Archie marked one man in particular&mdash;a tall, lean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
fellow, who was clinging to the main shrouds,
and shouting boisterously.</p>

<p>"Well, we can't lose Tuttle," said the mate,
with a grin, indicating the man in the shrouds.</p>

<p>The captain frowned; and Archie wondered
why. But he thought no more of the matter at
the moment&mdash;nor, indeed, until he met Tuttle
face to face&mdash;for the wind was now blowing
high; and that was enough to think of.</p>

<p>"Let it blow," said bluff Captain Hand.
"'Tis not the <em>wind</em> I cares about, b'y. 'Tis the
ice. I reckon there's a field o' drift ice offshore.
This nor'east gale will jam the harbour in an
hour, an' I don't want t' be trapped here
What's the time, now, Mr. Ackell?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-seven minutes yet, sir."</p>

<p>"Take her up off Skull Head. That's within
the law."</p>

<p>The drift ice was coming in fast. There was
a small field forming about the steamer, and
growing continuously. Out to sea, the night-light
now revealed a floe advancing with the
wind, threatening to seal tight the narrow harbour
entrance.</p>

<p>"If we have t' cut our way out," muttered the
captain, "we'll cut as little as we can. Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
Girth!" he roared to the second mate, "get the
bombs out. An' pick a crew that knows how t'
use 'em."</p>

<p>The <i>Dictator</i> moved forward through the
gathering ice towards Skull Head; and the three
other steamers, whose owners had chosen to
make the start from Long Tom, followed slyly
on her heels, evidently hoping to get to sea in
her wake, for she was larger than they. When
her engines were stopped off the Head, it lacked
twelve minutes of sailing time. An unbroken
field of ice lay beyond the harbour entrance,
momentarily jammed there. Would the ship be
locked in?</p>

<p>"Can't we run for it, sir?" asked the mate.
"'Tis but seven minutes too soon."</p>

<p>"No," said the captain. "We'll lie here t'
midnight t' the second. Then we'll ram that
floe, if we have t'. Hear me?" he burst out, such
was the tension upon patience. "We'll ram it!
We'll ram it!"</p>

<p>It appeared that they <em>would</em> have to. Archie
could hear the ice crunching as the floe pressed
in upon the jam. Pans were lifted out of
the water, and, under the mighty force of the
mass behind, were heaped up between the rocks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
on either side of the narrows. The barrier
seemed even now to be impassable; and it had
yet seven minutes to gather strength. If it
should prove too great to be broken, the fleet
might be locked in for a week; and with every
hour of delay the size of the prospective catch
would dwindle. The captains of the nearer vessels
were madly shouting to the old skipper of
the <i>Dictator</i> to strike before it was too late; but
he gave them no heed whatever. He stood with
his watch in his hand, waiting for the moment of
midnight.</p>

<p>"We're caught!" cried the mate.</p>

<p>The captain said nothing. He was watching
the jam&mdash;hoping that it would break of its own
weight.</p>

<p>"Three minutes, sir," said the mate.</p>

<p>The captain glanced at the watch in his
hand. "Two an' a half," he muttered, a moment
later.</p>

<p>A pause.</p>

<p>"Midnight, sir!" cried the mate.</p>

<p>"Go ahead!"</p>

<p>Archie heard the tinkle of the bell in the engineer's
room below: then the answering signal
on the bridge. The crew raised a cheer; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
mate pulled the whistle rope; there was a muffled
hurrah from the shore.</p>

<p>"Half speed! Port a little!"</p>

<p>The steamer gathered headway. She was
now making for the harbour entrance on a
straight course.</p>

<p>"Full speed!"</p>

<p>Then the <i>Dictator</i> charged the barrier.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<div class='summary'><i>In Which Archie Armstrong falls in with Bill
o' Burnt Bay and Billy Topsail of Ruddy Cove
and Makes a Speech</i></div>


<div class='drop-cap'>THERE is no telling what would have
happened had the <i>Dictator</i> struck the jam
of ice in the narrows of Long Tom Harbour.
Captain Hand was not the man to lose half
a voyage because there was a risk to be taken;
had he been used to counting the risk, he
would not have been in command of the finest
ship in Armstrong and Son's fine fleet. Rather
than be locked in the harbour, he had launched his
vessel at the barrier, quietly confident that she
would acquit herself well. But, as he had foreseen,
the jam broke of its own weight before the
steamer struck. Of a sudden, it cracked, and
gave way; the key blocks had broken. It then
remained only to breast the pack, which was not
at all an impossible undertaking for the stout
<i>Dictator</i>.</div>

<p>With her rivals following close, she struck the
floe, broke a way through, and pushed on, with
a great noise, but slowly, surely; and she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
soon in the open sea. The course was then
shaped northeast, for it appeared that open water
lay in that direction. The floe retarded the ship's
progress, but could not stop it; the ice pans
crashed against her prow and scraped her sides,
but she was staunch enough to withstand every
shock; and so, gaining on the rest of the fleet,
she crept out to sea, in the teeth of the rising gale.</p>

<p>At two o'clock in the morning, Archie Armstrong
was still on the bridge with the captain
and mate. The lights of the fleet were lost in
the night behind. The <i>Dictator</i> had laboured
through the first field of ice into open water.
The sea was dotted with great, white "pans,"
widely scattered; and, as the captain had feared,
there were signs of bergs in the darkness roundabout.
The waves were rising, spume crested,
on every hand; at intervals, they broke over the
bows, port and starboard, with frightful violence.
Gusts of wind whirled the spray to the bridge,
where it soon sheathed men and superstructure
in ice.</p>

<p>"Send a lookout aloft, Mr. Ackell," said the
captain, after he had long and anxiously peered
straight ahead.</p>

<p>The thud of ice, as the seas hurled it against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
the ship's prows, the hiss and crash of the waves,
the screaming of the gale, drowned the captain's
order.</p>

<p>"Pass the word for Bill o' Burnt Bay!" he
roared.</p>

<p>A short, brawny man, of middle age, who had
not missed a voyage to the ice in twenty years,
soon appeared in response to the call, which had
gone from mouth to mouth through the ship.
Archie was inclined to smile when he observed
Bill's unkempt, sandy moustache, which was
curiously given an upward twist at one side, and
a downward twist at the other. Nevertheless, he
was strongly attracted to him; for he looked like
a man who could be trusted to the limit of his
courage and strength.</p>

<p>"Take a glass t' the nest, b'y, an' look sharp
for bergs," the captain ordered. "Don't stay up
there. Come back an' report t' me here."</p>

<p>The man went off with a brisk, "Ay, ay, sir!"
It was his duty to clamber to the crow's-nest&mdash;a
cask lashed to the topmast just below the masthead&mdash;and
to sweep the sea for signs of bergs.</p>

<p>"'Tis more than I bargained for, Mr. Ackell,"
the captain went on, to the mate, in an anxious
undertone, which, however, Archie managed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
catch; and it may be added that the lad's heart
jumped into his throat, and had a hard time getting
back into place again.</p>

<p>"Dirty weather, sir!" the mate agreed. "I'm
thinkin' we're close to some heavy ice."</p>

<p>"Well," said the captain, after a pause, "keep
her head as she points now. I'll have a look
'tween decks."</p>

<p>Archie was tempted to ask the captain "if
there was any danger." The foolish question
was fairly on the tip of his tongue; but his better
sense came to his rescue in time. Danger? Of
course, there was! There was always danger.
He had surely not come on a sealing voyage expecting
none! But catastrophe was not yet inevitable.
At any rate, it was the captain's duty
to sail the ship. He was responsible to the
owners, and to the families of the crew; the part of
the passenger was but bravely to meet the fortune
that came. So, completely regaining his courage,
Archie followed the captain below.</p>

<p>'Tween decks the stout hearts were rollicking
still. The working crew had duty to do, every
man of them; but the two hundred hunters, who
had been taken along to wield gaff and club,
were sprawled in every place, singing, laughing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
yarning, scuffling, for all the world like a pack
of boys: making light of discomfort, and thinking
not at all of danger, for the elation of departure
still possessed them. Had any misgiving still remained
with Archie, the sight of this jolly, careless
crowd of hunters would have quieted it.
<em>They</em> were not alarmed. Then, why should he
be? Doubtless, it was responsibility that made
the captain anxious.</p>

<p>In the improvised cabin aft, Ebenezer Bowsprit,
of Exploits, was roaring the "Luck o' the
Northern Light," a famous old sealing song,
which, no doubt, his grandfather had sung to
shipmates upon similar occasions long ago.
Rough, frank faces, broadly smiling, were turned
to him; and when it came time for the chorus,
willing voices and mighty lungs swelled it to a
volume that put the very gale to shame. The
ship was pitching violently&mdash;with a nauseating
roll occasionally thrown in&mdash;and the cabin was
crowded and hot and filled with clouds of tobacco
smoke; but neither pitch, nor roll, nor heat, nor
smoke, could interfere with the jollity of the
occasion.</p>

<p>"All right here," the captain growled, grinning
in his great beard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>"Speech, Sir Archie!" shouted one of the
men.</p>

<p>Before Archie could escape&mdash;and amid great
laughter and uproar and louder calls for a speech&mdash;he
was caught by the arm, jerked off his feet,
and hoisted on the table, where he bumped his
head, and, by an especially violent roll of the
vessel, was almost thrown headlong into the
arms of the grinning crowd around him.</p>

<p>"Speech, speech!" they roared.</p>

<p>Archie would have declined with some heat
had he not caught sight of the face of Tim Tuttle&mdash;a
tawny, lean, long man, apparently as
strong as a wire rope. There was a steely twinkle
in his eye, and a sneering, utterly contemptuous
smile upon his thin lips. Archie did not
know that this was Tuttle's habitual expression.
He felt that the man expected a rather amusing
failure on the part of Sir Archibald Armstrong's
son; and that stimulated him to take the situation
seriously. Unconsciously calling his good
breeding to his aid, he pulled off his cap,
smoothed his hair, touched his cravat, and&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ahem!" he began; as he had heard the governor
of the colony do a dozen times, and as
now, to his surprise, he found most inspiring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hear, hear!" burst rapturously from old
Ebenezer Bowsprit.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i008.jpg" width="350" height="412" alt="men listening to boy" />
<div class="caption">HE WAS NEAR THE END OF THE SIXTEENTH VERSE.</div>
</div>

<p>Ebenezer was in a condition of high delight
and expectation. Admiration shone in his eyes,
surprise was depicted by his wide opened mouth,
bewonderment by his strained attention. The
sight of his face was too much for Archie.</p>

<p>"Oh, what Tommy-rot!" he laughed. "Here,
let me go! I can't (hold me up, or I'll fall) make
a speech. ("Hear, hear!" from the awe-stricken
Ebenezer.) All I got to say is that I'm (<em>please</em>
get a better hold on my legs, or I'll be pitched
off) mighty glad to be here. I'm having the
best time of my life, and I expect to have a better
one when we strike the seals. (Loud and
prolonged cheering.) I hope&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But, in the excitement following his last remark,
the speaker's support was withdrawn, and
a pitch of the ship threw him off the table. He
was caught, set on his feet, and clapped on the
back. Then he managed to escape with the
captain, followed by loud cries of "More!
More!" to which he felt justified in paying no
attention.</p>

<p>"You're your father's son," laughed the captain,
as they made their way up the deck.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
"Sure, your father never in his life let slip a
chance t' make a speech."</p>

<p>In the forecastle they had a lad on the table
under the lantern&mdash;a tow-headed, blue-eyed,
muscular boy, of Archie's age, or less. He had
on goatskin boots, a jacket of homespun, and a
flaring red scarf. The men were quiet; for the
boy was piping, in a clear, quavering treble, the
"Song o' the Anchor an' Chain," a Ruddy Cove
saga, which goes to the air of a plaintive West
Country ballad of the seventeenth century, with
the refrain,</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Sure, the chain 'e parted,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">An' the schooner drove ashoare,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">An' the wives o' the 'ands</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">No moare!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Never saw un any mo-o-o-are!"</span><br />
</div>

<p>He was near the end of the sixteenth verse,
and the men were drawing breath for the chorus,
when the captain appeared in the door, wrath in
his eyes.</p>

<p>"What's this?" roared he.</p>

<p>There was no answer. The lad turned to face
the captain, in part deferentially, in part humorously,
altogether fearlessly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<div class='summary'><i>Billy Topsail is Shipped Upon Conditions, and
the Dictator, in a Rising Gale, is Caught in
a Field of Drift Ice, with a Growler to Leeward</i></div>


<div class='drop-cap'>"WHERE'D you come aboard, b'y?"
Captain Hand demanded.</div>

<p>"Long Tom, sir."</p>

<p>"Who shipped you?"</p>

<p>"I stowed away in a bunker, sir."</p>

<p>"You're from Ruddy Cove?" said the captain.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Me name's Billy, an' me father's
a Labrador fisherman. Sure, I've sailed t' the
French Shore, sir, an' I'm a handy lad t' work,
sir."</p>

<p>"Billy what?"</p>

<p>"Topsail, sir."</p>

<p>The captain raised his eyebrows; then dropped
them, and stared at the boy. He had been before
the mast with old Tom Topsail on a South
American barque in years long gone.</p>

<p>"You'll work hard, b'y," said he, severely, for
he had been bothered with stowaways for thirty
years, "an' I'll ship you regular, if you do your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
duty. If you don't," and here the captain frowned
tremendously, "I'll have you thrashed at the post
at Long Tom, an' you'll have no share with the
crew in the cargo."</p>

<p>"Ay, sir," said Billy, gladly. "Sure, I'll stand
by it, sir."</p>

<p>When the captain turned his back, out came
the belated chorus, with young Billy Topsail
leading:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Sure, the chain 'e parted,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">An' the schooner drove ashoare,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">An' the wives o' the 'ands</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Never saw un any moare.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">No moare!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Never saw un any mo-o-o-are!"</span><br />
</div>

<p>"If he's like his dad," the captain chuckled to
Archie, as they mounted to the deck, "his name
will be on the ship's books before the v'y'ge is
over, sure enough."</p>

<p>It appeared from the bridge that the gale was
venting the utmost of its force. The wind had
veered a point or two to the north, and was driving
out of the darkness a vast field of broken ice.
This, close packed and grinding, was bearing
down swiftly. It threatened to block the ship's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
course&mdash;if not to surround her, take hold of her,
and sweep her away. In the northeast, dead
over the bows, there loomed a great white mass,
a berg, grandly towering, with its peaks hidden
in black, scudding clouds. Beyond, and on either
side, patches of white, vanishing and reappearing,
disclosed the whereabouts of other bergs.</p>

<p>"I was thinkin' about slowin' down," said the
mate, when the captain had scanned the prospect
ahead.</p>

<p>With that, some part of Archie's alarm returned.
It continued with him, while the captain
moved the lever of the signal box until the indicator
marked half speed, while the ship lost
way, and the engines throbbed, as though alive
and breathing hard.</p>

<p>"Report, sir!"</p>

<p>This was Bill o' Burnt Bay, down from the
crow's-nest, with his beard frozen to his jacket
and icicles hanging from his shaggy eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"They's a big field o' ice bearin' down with
the wind. 'Tis heavy, an' comin' fast, an' 'tis
stretchin' as far as I can see. They's five
good-sized bergs ahead, sir, with pan ice all
about them. An'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>"Growlers?" sharply.</p>

<p>"An' they's a big growler off the port bow.
'Twill soon be dead t' leeward, if we keeps this
course."</p>

<p>Bill o' Burnt Bay lumbered down the ladder
and made for the forecastle to thaw out. Meantime,
the captain devoted himself to giving the
growler a wide berth; for a growler is a berg
which trembles on the verge of toppling over,
and he had no wish to be caught between it and
the advancing floe. He had once lost a schooner
that way; the adventure was one of his most
vivid recollections.</p>

<p>"We'll have t' get out o' this, Mr. Ackell,"
he said, "or we may get badly nipped. We'll
tie up t' the first steady berg we come to.
Here, b'y," sharply, to Archie, "you'll not go t'
bed for a while. Keep near me&mdash;but keep out
o' the way."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir!"</p>

<p>"Turn out all hands!"</p>

<p>The cry of "All hands on deck!" was passed
fore and aft. It ran through the ship like an
alarm. The men trooped from below, wondering
what had occasioned it. Once on deck, a
swift glance into the driving night apprised these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
old sealers of the situation. They placed the ice
hooks and tackle in handy places; for the work
in hand was plain enough.</p>

<p>The ship was swinging wide of the growler,
against which the wind beat with mighty force.
A vast surface was exposed to the gale; and
upon every square foot a varying pressure was
exerted. As the vessel drew nearer, Archie could
see the iceberg yield and sway. It was evident
that its submerged parts had been melted and
worn until the equilibrium of the whole was nearly
overset. A sudden, furious gust might turn the
scale; and in that event a near-by vessel would
surely be overwhelmed.</p>

<p>Captain Hand kept a watchful eye on the ice
pack, which had now come within a hundred
fathoms, and was hurrying upon the advancing
ship. The vessel was between the floe and the
growler: a situation not to be escaped, as the
captain had foreseen. The danger was clear: if
the rush of the floe should be too great for the
steamer to withstand, she would be swept, broadside
on, against the berg, which, being of greater
weight and depth, moved sluggishly. Stout as
she was, she could not survive the collision.</p>

<p>The captain turned her bow to the pack; then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
he signalled full speed ahead. There was a
moment of waiting.</p>

<p>"Grab the rail, b'y," said the captain.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir!"</p>

<p>The floe divided before the ship; the shock
was hardly perceptible. For a moment, where,
at the edge, the ice was loose, she maintained her
speed. But the floe thickened. The fragments
were packed tight. It was as though the face of
the sea were covered with a solid sheet of ice,
lying ahead as far as sight carried into the night.
The ship laboured. Her speed diminished,
gradually, but perceptibly&mdash;vividly so! Her
progress was soon at the rate of half speed. In
a moment it was even slower than that. Would
it stop altogether?</p>

<p>Archie was on the port side of the bridge. The
captain walked over to him and slapped him
heartily on the back.</p>

<p>"Well, b'y," he cried, "how do you like the
sealin' v'y'ge?"</p>

<p>That was a clever thought of the captain!
Here was a man in desperate case who could
await the issue in light patience. The boy took
heart at the thought of it; and he needed that
encouragement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>"I knew what it was when I started," he replied,
with a gulp.</p>

<p>"Will she make it, think you?"</p>

<p>Another clever ruse of this great heart! He
wanted the boy to have a part in the action.
Archie felt the blood stirring in his veins once
again.</p>

<p>"She's pretty near steady, sir, I think," he replied,
after a pause.</p>

<p>The two leaned over the rail and looked intently
at the ice sweeping past.</p>

<p>"Are we losing, sir?" asked the boy.</p>

<p>"I think we're holdin' our own," said the
captain, elatedly.</p>

<p>The boy turned to the great growler, now
vague of outline in the dark. The ice floe had
swept over the limit of vision. He wondered if
it had struck the base of the berg. Then all at
once the heap of cloudy white swayed forth and
back before his eyes. For a moment it was like
a gigantic curtain waving in the wind. It vanished
of a sudden. A mountain of broken water
shot up in its place&mdash;as high as its topmost pinnacle
had been; and, following close upon its fall,
another berg, with a worn outline, reared itself,
dripping streams of water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus far there had been no sound; but the
sound beat its way against the wind, at last, and
it was a thunderous noise&mdash;"like the growlin' of
a million dogs," the captain said afterwards. The
growler had capsized.</p>

<p>"Look!" the boy cried, overcome.</p>

<p>"Turned turtle, ain't she?" remarked the
skipper, calmly.</p>

<p>"The pack might have carried us near it!"</p>

<p>"Oh," said the captain, lightly, "but it didn't.
She's a good ship, the <i>Dictator</i>. What's more,"
he added, "she's makin' her way right through
the pack."</p>

<p>Another berg had taken form over the port
quarter. The captain shaped a course for it, eyeing
it carefully as he drew near. It was low&mdash;not
higher than the ship's spars&mdash;and broad,
with the impression of stability strong upon it.</p>

<p>"See that berg, b'y?" said the captain.
"Well," decisively, "we'll lie in the lee o' that
in half an hour. You see, b'y," he went on,
"the wind makes small bother for a solid berg.
It whips the pan ice along, easy enough, but the
bergs float their own way, quiet as you please.
In the lee of every big fellow like that, there's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
open water. We'll lie there, tied up, till
mornin'."</p>

<p>In half an hour, the ship broke from the ice
into the lee of the berg. The floe raced past
under the force of the gale, which left the lee air
and water untouched by its violence. Skillful
seamanship brought the vessel broadside to the
ice. A wild commotion ensued: orders roared
from the bridge, signal bells, the shouts of the
line men, the hiss of steam, and the churning of
the screw. Archie saw young Billy Topsail
scramble to the ice like a cat, with the first line
in his hand: then Bill o' Burnt Bay and half a
dozen others, with axes and hooks.</p>

<p>In twenty minutes the engines were at rest, the
ship was lying like a log in a mill pond, the
watch paced the deck in solitude, and Archibald
Armstrong was asleep in his berth in the captain's
cabin&mdash;dreaming that the mate was wrong
and the captain right: that the gale had abated
in the night, and the morning had broken sunny.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

<div class='summary'><i>In Which Archie Armstrong and Billy Topsail
Have an Exciting Encounter with a Big Dog
Hood, and, at the Sound of Alarm, Leave the
Issue in Doubt, While the Ice Goes Abroad and
the Enemy Goes Swimming</i></div>


<div class='drop-cap'>HAIR seals, which come out of the north
with the ice in the early spring, and drift
in great herds past the rugged Newfoundland
coast, returning in April, have no close, soft
fur next the skin, such as the South Sea and Alaskan
seals have. Hence, they are valued only for
their blubber, which is ground and steamed into
oil, and for their skin, which is turned into leather.
They are of two kinds, the harp which is doubtless
indigenous to the great inland sea and the
waters above, and the hood, which inhabits the
harsher regions of the farther north and east.
The harp is timid, gentle, gregarious, and takes
in packs to the flat, newly frozen, landward
pans; the hood is fierce, quarrelsome and solitary,
grimly riding the rough glacier ice at the
edge of the open sea.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus the <i>Dictator</i> lay through the night with
hood ice all about the sheltering berg.</p>

<p>"Hi, b'y! Get yarry (wide awake)!" cried
the captain, in the morning.</p>

<p>Archie Armstrong was "yarry" on the instant,
and he rolled out of his berth in hot haste, not at
all sure that it was not time to leave a sinking
ship in the boats. The hairy face of the old
sealer, a broad, kindly grin upon it, peered at
him from the door.</p>

<p>"Morning, skipper!"</p>

<p>"Mornin' t' you, sir. An' a fine mornin' 'tis,"
said the captain. "Sure a finer I never saw."</p>

<p>"What's become of the gale?"</p>

<p>"The gale's miles t' the sou'east&mdash;an' out o'
sight o' these latitudes. We're packed in the lee
o' the berg, an' fast till the wind changes. There's
a family o' hoods, quarter mile t' starboard. Up,
now, b'y! an' you'll go after them with a crew
after breakfast."</p>

<p>When Archie reached the deck, the air was
limpid, frosty and still. There was a blue sky
overhead, stretching from horizon to horizon. A
waste of ice lay all about&mdash;rough, close-packed,
glistening in the sun. With the falling away of
the wind the floe had lost its headway, and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
crept softly in upon the open water. The ship
was held in the grip of the pack, and must perforce
remain for a time in the shadow of the berg,
where shelter from the gale of the night had been
sought. Save for the watch of that hour, the
men were below, at breakfast. The "great
white silence" possessed the sea. For the boy,
this silence, vast and heavy, and the immeasurable
area of broken ice, with its pent-up, treacherous
might, was as awe-impelling as the gale
and the night.</p>

<p>"What d'ye think, Mr. Ackell?" said the captain
to the mate, when the two came up.</p>

<p>Ackell looked to the northeast. "We'll have
wind by noon," he replied.</p>

<p>"'Tis what I think," the captain agreed.
"Archie, b'y, you'll have a couple of hours, afore
the ice goes abroad. Bowsprit 'll take the crew,
an' you'll do what he tells you."</p>

<p>Ebenezer Bowsprit, with half a dozen cronies
of his own choosing, led the way over the side, in
high good humour. In the group on the deck
stood Billy Topsail. He eyed Archie with frank
envy as the lad prepared to descend to the ice;
for to participate in the first hunt, generally regarded
as pure sport, was a thing greatly to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
desired. He was perceived by Archie, who was
at once taken with a wish for company of his
own age.</p>

<p>"Captain," the boy whispered, "let the other
kid come along, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Topsail," the captain ordered, "get a gaff,
an' cut along with the rest."</p>

<p>In five minutes, the boys had broken the ice of
diffidence, and were chatting like sociable magpies,
as they crawled, jumped, climbed, over the
uneven pack. They were Newfoundlanders both:
the same in strength, feeling, spirit, and, indeed,
experience. The one was of the remote outports,
where children are reared to toil and peril,
which, with hunger, is their heritage, and must
ever be; the other was of the city, son of the
well-to-do, who, following sport for sport's sake,
had made the same ventures and become used to
the same toil and peril.</p>

<p>"'Tis barb'rous hard walkin'," said Billy.</p>

<p>"Sure," replied the other. "And they're getting
away ahead of us."</p>

<p>Ebenezer Bowsprit and his fellows, with the
lust of the chase strong upon them, were making
great strides towards three black objects
some hundred yards away. It was a race; for it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
is a tradition that he who strikes the first blow of
the voyage will have "luck" the season through.
The boys were hopelessly behind, and they
stopped to look about them. It was then that
Billy Topsail spied a patch of open water, to the
left, half hidden by the surrounding ice. It was
a triangular hole in the floe, formed by three
heavy blocks, which had withstood the pressure
of the pack.</p>

<p>"Look!" he cried.</p>

<p>A head, small and alert, raised upon a thick,
supple neck, appeared. A moment later, a
second head popped out of the water. They
were hoods. The young one, the pup, must lie
near. The boys stood stock still until the seals
had clambered to the pack. Then they advanced
swiftly. Billy Topsail was armed with a gaff,
which is a pole shod with iron at one end and
having a hook at the other; and Archie was provided
with a sealing club. They came upon the
dog hood before he could escape to the water.
Perceiving this, and only on this account, he
turned, snarling, to give fight.</p>

<p>"I'll take him!" cried Billy.</p>

<p>The hood was as big as an ox&mdash;a massive,
flabby, vicious beast. He was furiously aroused,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
and he would now fight to the death, with no
thought of retreat. He raised himself on his flippers
and reared his head to the length of his long
neck, as the boy, stepping cautiously, gaff poised,
drew near.</p>


<p>"Get behind him," Billy shouted to Archie.</p>

<p>Billy advanced fearlessly, steadily, never for a
moment taking his eyes from the hood's head.
Upon that head, from the nose to the back of the
neck, the tough, bladder-like "hood" was now
inflated. It was a perfect protection; the boy
might strike blow after blow without effect. The
stroke must be thrust at the throat; and it must
be a stroke swiftly, cunningly, strongly delivered.
A furious hood, excited past fear, is a match
for three men. The odds were against the
lad. He had been carried away by his own
daring.</p>

<p>But Billy made the thrust, and the seal received
the point of the gaff on his hood, as upon
a shield: then advanced on his flippers, by jerky
jumps, snapping viciously. Archie cried out.
But Billy had skipped out of harm's way, and
had faced about, laughing. He returned to the
attack, undismayed, though the seal reared to
meet him, with bared teeth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 380px;">
<img src="images/i009.jpg" width="380" height="308" alt="two fighitng a walrus" />
<div class="caption">THEN HE ADVANCED UPON THE BOY.</div>
</div>

<p>"Strike!" screamed Archie.</p>

<p>Teeth and flippers were to be feared, and Billy
had drawn nearly within reach of both. He
paused, waiting his opportunity. Archie could
not contain his excitement.</p>

<p>"Strike!" he cried again.</p>

<p>Billy struck; but the blow had no force, for he
slipped, overreached, lost his footing, and fell
sprawling, almost within reach of his adversary's
teeth. The seal snarled and drew back, startled.
Then he advanced upon the boy, who had had
no time to recover, much less to scramble out of
his desperate situation.</p>

<p>It was for Archie to act. He leaped forward
from his position behind the seal, struck the
animal with full force upon the tail, and darted
out of reach. The hood snorted, and turned in
a rage to face his new assailant. Billy leaped to
his feet, gaff in hand, and faced about, panting,
but ready. He was preparing to attack again,
when&mdash;</p>

<p>"What's that?" Archie cried in alarm.</p>

<p>It was the boom of the ship's gun, followed by
an ominous, hollow crackling, which ran into the
distance like a long peal of thunder. The floe
seemed to be turning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Tis goin' abroad!" Billy shouted. "Quick,
b'y! T' the ship!"</p>

<p>The boys had been out of sight of the ship,
hidden by a shoulder of the berg. They had not
seen the flag of recall, which had been flying for
ten minutes. Again they heard the report of the
gun; and they saw Ebenezer Bowsprit and his
men making shipwards with all speed. Billy
was fully aware of the danger. With another
warning cry to Archie, he started off on a run,
turning from time to time to make sure that his
companion was following.</p>

<p>The ice was nauseatingly unstable, grinding
and shifting; but no open water had as yet appeared,
though, at any moment, a lane might
open up and cut off the retreat. The floe was
feeling the force of a wind in the north, and was
stirring itself from edge to edge. It would soon
be shaken into its separate parts. But with
Billy Topsail leading, the boys ran steadily over
the heaving foothold, and in good time came to
the ship, which the rest of the hunting party had
already boarded.</p>

<p>Billy Topsail was laughing.</p>

<p>"I don't feel that way," said Archie, "we
were in a good deal of danger."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>Billy laughed louder.</p>

<p>"Well, we <em>were</em>, weren't we?" Archie demanded.</p>

<p>"Maybe," said Billy; "but you'll get used t'
<em>that!</em>"</p>

<p>They were not a moment too soon, however;
for the pack very quickly fell apart&mdash;thus opening
a way for the escape of the <i>Dictator</i>. And
meantime, the gallant old dog hood had followed
the retreating figures with his eyes: after which,
well satisfied with himself, he slipped into the
water and went fishing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>

<div class='summary'><i>The Dictator Charges an Ice Pan and Loses a
Main Topmast</i></div>


<div class='drop-cap'>"CAST loose!" was the order from the
bridge.</div>

<p>The men scrambled to the berg and
released the lines and ice-hooks. The pack was
still loosening under the rising breeze. To the
east, separating the sky from the ice, lay a long
black streak&mdash;the water of the open sea; a clear
way to the broad, white fields. Once free of the
floe, the ship would speed northward to the Yellow
Islands and Cape William coasts. In a day and
a night, the weather continuing propitious, it
would be, "Ho! for the ice. Ho! for the seals."</p>

<p>A lane of water opened up. "Go ahead," was
the signal from the master on the bridge, and the
ship moved forward, with her nose turned to the
sea.</p>

<p>"Ha, Mr. Ackell!" exclaimed the captain, rubbing
his horny hands. "Looks t' be a fine time,
man. We'll make the Yellow Islands at dawn
t'-morrow, if all goes well."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>When the <i>Dictator</i> had followed the lane to
within one hundred yards of free water, the advance
was blocked by a great pan of ice, tight
jammed in the pack on either side. So fast and
vagrantly was the floe shifting its formation that
what had been a clear path was now crossed by
a mighty barrier. Here was no slob ice to be
forged through at full steam, but a solid mass,
like a bar of iron, lying across the path.</p>

<p>The ship was taken to the edge of the obstruction,
and the captain and mate went forward to
the bow to gauge the strength of it. When they
came back to the bridge, the former had his teeth
set.</p>

<p>"It's stiff work for the old ship," said the
mate.</p>

<p>The captain growled as he pulled the signal
lever for full speed astern.</p>

<p>"Take half a day to cut a way through," he
said. "We'll ram it. Here, b'y," to Archie,
"get off the bridge. You're in the way."</p>

<p>Archie joined Billy Topsail on the forward
deck. Neither had yet experienced a charge on
a pan of ice; but both had listened, open eyed,
to the sealing tales of daring that had brought
disaster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>"I feel queer," Archie remarked.</p>

<p>"Cap'n Hand," said Billy, as though trying to
revive his faith in the old skipper, "he's a clever
one. 'Tis all right."</p>

<p>"Make fast below," the captain shouted over
the bridge rail.</p>

<p>The word was passed in a lively fashion.
Tackle, boats, and all things loose, were lashed
in their places, as if for a great gale.</p>

<p>"Stop!" was the next signal. Then: "Full
speed ahead!"</p>

<p>The blow had been launched! A moment
later, the <i>Dictator</i> was ploughing forward, charging
the pan, which she must strike like a battering
ram, and shiver to pieces. She was of solid
oak, this good ship, and builded for such attacks;
steel plates would buckle and spring under such
shocks as she had many times triumphantly sustained.
The men were silent while they awaited
the event. There was not a sound save the hiss
of the water at the ship's prows, and the <em>chug-chug</em>
of the engines.</p>

<p>Archie caught his breath. His eyes were fixed
on the fast vanishing space of water. The thrill
of the adventure was manifest in Billy Topsail's
sharp, quick breathing, and in his blue eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
which were as though about to pop out of their
sockets.</p>

<p>"Stop!"</p>

<p>The engines abruptly ceased their labour.
Only a fathom or two of water lay ahead. The
ship was about to strike. There was a long
drawn instant of suspense. Then came the
blow!</p>

<p>It was a fearful shock. The vessel quivered,
crushed her way on for a space, and stopped dead,
quivering still. A groan ran over her, from stem
to stern, as though she had been racked in every
part. The main topmast snapped and fell forward
on the rigging with a crash.</p>

<p>A volley of cracks sounded from the ice, like
the discharge of a thousand rifles, slowly subsiding.
Dead silence fell and continued for a moment.
Then the screw churned the water, and
the ship backed off, sound, but beaten; for the
pan of ice lay, unbroken and unchanged, in its
place, with but a jagged bruise, where the blow
had been struck.</p>

<p>"Aloft, there, some o' you, an' cut away that
spar!" the captain shouted. "Bill, get below,
an' see if she's tight. Here, you, Dickson, call
the watch t' make sail. Mr. Girth," to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
second mate, "take a crew t' the ice. Blast that
pan in three places. Lively, now, every man o'
you!"</p>

<p>Roaring subordinates, answering "Ay, ay,
sirs!" rattling blocks and chains, the fall of
hurried feet, cries of warning and encouragement,
the engine's gasps: these sounds confounded the
confusion, and continued it, while the ship, snorting
like a frightened horse, was backed to her first
position.</p>

<p>"He'll try it again," Archie gleefully observed
to Billy.</p>

<p>The captain was pacing the bridge. Try it
again? He was in a fever of impatience to be at
it! It was as though the pan of ice were a foe
needing only another and a heavier blow to be
beaten down.</p>

<p>"Sure," said Billy, after a glance to the bridge,
"he'll hit that pan till he smashes it, if it takes till
Tibb's Eve!"</p>

<p>"Tibb's Eve?"</p>

<p>"Sure, b'y. Does you not know what that is?
'Tis till the end o' the world."</p>

<p>The ship was again to be launched against the
pan. The second mate took the blasting crew to
the ice in the quarter boat; and he lost no time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
about it, as the captain made sure. Up aloft went
other hands to cut away the broken spar and
loose the canvas. Work was carried on under
the spur of the captain's harshened voice; for the
captain was in a passion to prove the quality of
his ship.</p>

<p>The ice picks were plied as fast as arms could
swing them. Soon the mines were laid and fired.
And when the dust of ice had fallen, and the
noise of the explosion had gone rumbling into
the distance, three gaping holes marked the pan
at regular intervals from edge to edge.</p>

<p>"She's all tight below, sir," was the carpenter's
report.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Ackell," said the captain, grimly,
"in ten minutes we'll be free o' the ice, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>They made all sail. After a quiet word or two
of command, forth the ship shot, heeling to the
breeze, wind now allied with steam. Her course
was laid straight for the jagged bruise in the pan.
There was no stopping her now. The ice was
cracked and shivered into a thousand pieces.
The ship forged on, grinding the cakes to fragments,
heaping them up, riding them down. She
quivered when she struck, and strained and
creaked as she crushed her way forward, but she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
crept on, invincible, adding inch to inch, foot to
foot, until she swept out into the unclogged water.</p>

<p>Then she shook the ice from her screw, and ran
grandly into the swelling sea.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" the stout hearts roared.</p>

<p>"Hem&mdash;hem! Mr. Ackell," said the captain,
with some emotion, "'tis a great ship!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It occurred to Archie that night, while he sat
munching hard biscuit with the captain before
turning in, to ask a few questions about Tim
Tuttle. What was the matter with the man?
Why did he go about with a sneer or a frown
forever on his face? Why was he not like all
the rest of the crew? Why did the crew seem to
expect him to "do" something? Why did the
captain flush and bristle when Tuttle came
near?</p>

<p>"Oh," the captain replied, with a laugh, "Tuttle
had a fallin' out with me when we was young.
I think," he added, gravely, "that he wronged
me. But that's neither here nor there. I forgave
him. The point is&mdash;an' I've often run across
the same thing in my life&mdash;that he won't forgive
<em>me</em> for forgivin' <em>him</em>. That's odd, isn't it? But
it's true. An' he's aboard here t' make trouble;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
an' the men know that that's just what he came
for."</p>

<p>"But what did you ship him for, captain, if
you knew that?"</p>

<p>The captain paused. "Well," he said, "because
I'm only a man, I s'pose. I couldn't help
knockin' the chip off his shoulder."</p>

<p>"Do you think he <em>can</em> make trouble?"</p>

<p>"I'd like t' see him try!" the captain burst
out, wrathfully.</p>

<p>Tuttle's opportunity occurred the next day.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>

<div class='summary'><i>In Which Seals are Sighted and Archie Armstrong
has a Narrow Chance in the Crow's-Nest.</i></div>


<div class='drop-cap'>AT peep o' dawn the <i>Dictator</i> made the
Groais Island sealing grounds. The day
broke late and dull. The sky was a dead
gray, hanging heavily over a dark, fretful sea;
and there was a threat of wind and snow in the
air.</div>

<p>"Ice, sir!" said the mate, poking his head into
the captain's cabin, his ceremony lost in his elation.</p>

<p>"Take her 'longside," cried the captain, jumping
out of his berth. "What's it like?"</p>

<p>"Looks like a big field o' seal ice, sir."</p>

<p>"Hear that, b'y?" the captain shouted to
Archie, who was sitting up in his berth, still rubbing
his eyes. "A field o' ice! There'll be a
hunt t'-day. Mr. Ackell, tell the cook t' send the
breakfast up here. What's the weather?"</p>

<p>"Promisin' thick, sir."</p>

<p>When the captain and the boy went on deck,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
the ice was in plain sight&mdash;many vast fields, rising
over the horizon continually, so that there
seemed to be no end to it. From the crow's-nest
it had been reported to the mate, who reported
to the captain, that the spars of a three-masted
ship were visible, and that the vessel was apparently
lying near the ice. That was considered
bad news&mdash;and worse news yet, when it was reported
from the crow's-nest that she was flying
the house-flag of Alexander Bryan &amp; Company,
the only considerable rival of the firm of Armstrong
and Son.</p>

<p>"Oh, well," said the captain, making the best
of it in a generous way, "there'll be 25,000 seals
in that pack, an' out o' that we ought t' bag
enough t' pay both of us for the day's work."</p>

<p>Archie caught sight of Billy Topsail, who was
standing on the forward deck, gazing wistfully
at him; so he went forward, and the two found
much to say to each other, while the ship made
for the ice under full steam. They fought the
fight with the dog hood over again; and when
Billy had acknowledged a debt to Archie's quick
thought, and Archie had repudiated it with some
heat, they agreed that the old seal had been a
mighty fellow, and a game one, deserving his escape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
from continued attack. Then they abandoned
the subject.</p>

<p>"Pretty hard work on the ice," Archie observed,
sagely.</p>

<p>"Sure!" Billy exclaimed; for that had been
clear to him all his life. "'Tis fearful dangerous,
too. When my father was young, he was to the
ice in a schooner, an' they got caught with the fleet
in raftin' ice<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> offshore, up Englee way. He saw
six schooners nipped; an' they were all crushed
like an egg, an' went down when the ice went
abroad. His was the only one o' all the fleet
that stood the crush."</p>

<p>"Think you'll share with the crew, Billy?"</p>

<p>"I want to," Billy said with a laugh. Then,
soberly: "I want to, for I want t' get a skiff for
lobster-fishin' in New Bay. They's lots o' lobsters
there, an' they's no one trappin' down that
way. 'Tis a great chance," with a sigh.</p>

<p>The captain beckoned Archie to the upper
deck. "Tell me, now," he said, when the boy
reached his side, "can you go aloft?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Archie answered, laughing scornfully.
"I'm no landsman!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>
<p>"True word, if you're son of your father!
Then get up with the bar'l man, an' take a trick
at swatchin'. 'Tis cold work, but great sport."</p>

<p>"Swatching" is merely the convenient form for
"seal watching." It appeared to Archie that to
swatch with the barrel man must be a highly
diverting occupation. He was not slow to mount
the rope ladder to the masthead, and slip into the
cask with the swatcher, who chanced to be Bill o'
Burnt Bay and vociferously made him welcome.</p>

<p>"See anything yet?" asked the boy.</p>

<p>"I'll show you them swiles (seals) in a minute
or two," Bill replied confidently.</p>

<p>Archie was closely muffled in wool and fur;
but the wind, which was bitter and blowing hard,
searched out the unprotected places, and in five
minutes he was crouching in the cask for shelter,
only too glad to find an excuse in the swatcher's
advice.</p>

<p>"H-h-h-how l-l-long you been h-h-here?" he
chattered.</p>

<p>"Sure, b'y," said Bill, with no suspicion of a
shiver in his voice, "'tis goin' on two hours,
now."</p>

<p>"P-p-pretty cold, i-i-isn't it?"</p>

<p>Bill o' Burnt Bay did not reply. His eye was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
glued to the telescope, which fairly shook in his
hands. Then he leaned over the rim of the cask,
altogether disregarding its instability.</p>

<p>"Seals ho!" he roared.</p>

<p>A cheer went up. Looking down, Archie saw
the men swarming to the deck.</p>

<p>"Take a look at them harps, b'y," said Bill,
excitedly. "No! Starboard the glass. There!
See them?"</p>

<p>Archie made out a myriad of moving specks&mdash;black
dots, small and great, shifting about over a
broad white surface. They were like many insects.
He saw Alexander Bryan &amp; Company's
vessel, too; and it appeared to him that the men
were just landing on the ice to attack the pack.</p>

<p>"That's the <i>Lucky Star</i>," Bill explained.
"She's a smaller ship than we, an' she've got
about a hundred men, I s'pose. Never fear, lad,
we'll be up in time t' get our share o' the
swiles."</p>

<p>"I-I-I-I g-g-guess I'll g-g-go down, now," said
Archie.</p>

<p>Half an hour of exposure in the crow's-nest had
chilled the lad to numbness. His blood was running
sluggishly; he was shivering; his legs were
stiff, and his hands were cold and uncertain in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
their grip. He climbed out of the cask, and
cleverly enough made good his footing on the
platform of the nest. It was when he essayed
the descent that he erred and faltered.</p>

<p>He had a full, two-handed grip on the topmast
backstays, and was secure in searching with his
foot for the rope ladder lashed thereto. But
when his foot struck, he released his left hand
from the stays, without pausing to make sure
that his foot was firm-fixed on the rung. His foot
missed the rung altogether, and found no place
to rest. In a flash, he had rolled over, and hung
suspended by one hand, which, numb though it
was, had unexpectedly to bear the weight of his
whole body.</p>

<p>"Be careful goin' down, b'y," he heard Bill o'
Burnt Bay say.</p>

<p>The voice seemed to come out of a great distance.
Archie knew, in a dim way, that the
attention of the man was fixed elsewhere&mdash;doubtless
on the herd of harps. Then he fell into a
stupefaction of terror. It seemed to him, in his
panic, that Bill would never discover his situation;
that he must hang there, with his grip loosening,
instant by instant&mdash;until he fell.</p>

<p>He was speechless, incapable of action, when,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
by chance, Bill o' Burnt Bay looked down. The
sealer quietly reached over the cask and caught
him by the collar; then lifted him to the platform,
and there held him fast. Each looked silently,
tensely, into the other's eyes.</p>

<p>"'Tis a cold day," said Bill, dryly.</p>

<p>Archie gasped.</p>

<p>"Tough on tender hands, b'y," said Bill.</p>

<p>"Yes," gasped the lad, in a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>There was a long silence, through which the
swatcher looked Archie in the eye, holding him
tight all the while.</p>

<p>"'Tis not wise t' be in a hurry, sometimes,"
he observed, at last.</p>

<p>The boy waited until he could view the necessity
of descent with composure. Then, with extreme
caution, he made his way to the deck, and
went to the cabin, where he warmed himself over
the stove. Apparently, the incident had passed
unnoticed from the deck. He said nothing about
it to the captain, nor to any one else; nor did
Bill o' Burnt Bay, who had an adequate conception
of the sensitiveness of lads in respect to such
narrow chances.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>

<div class='summary'><i>The Ice Runs Red, and, in Storm and Dusk, Tim
Tuttle Brews a Pot o' Trouble for Captain
Hand, While Billy Topsail Observes the Operation</i></div>


<div class='drop-cap'>MEANTIME the ship drew near the ice.
When Archie came again on deck, his
nerves quite composed, she was being
driven in and out through the fields to a point as
near to the first seal pack as she could be taken&mdash;a
mile distant, at the least. During this tedious
search for a landing place, the crew's eager
excitement passed the bounds of discipline. The
men could see the crew from Alexander Bryan &amp;
Company's <i>Lucky Star</i> at work; and that excited
them the more: they were mad to reach
the ice before their rivals could molest the pack
for which they were bound.</div>

<p>When, at last, the engines were stopped, a
party of sixty was formed in a haphazard fashion;
the boats were lowered in haste, and the men
leaped and tumbled into them, crowding them
down to the gunwales. In one of the boats were
Archie and Billy, the former in the care of Bill o'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
Burnt Bay, to whom the "nursing" was not altogether
agreeable, under the circumstances; the
latter in charge of himself, a lenient guardian,
but a wise one.</p>

<p>"Don't get into trouble with the crew o' the
<i>Lucky Star</i>," had been the captain's last command.</p>

<p>The men landed, hurrahing, and at once organized
into half a dozen separate expeditions.
The direction to be taken by each was determined
by the leaders, and they set off at a dog trot
upon their diverging paths over the ice to the
widely distributed seal pack. Meantime, the
boats were taken back to the ship and hoisted in;
and the ship steamed off to land another party
on another field, thence to land the last party
near a third pack.</p>

<p>The boys trotted in Bill's wake. Two pennant
bearers, carrying flags to mark the heaps of "fat,"
as they should be formed, led the file. One of
these men&mdash;it happened by chance, to all appearances&mdash;was
the captain's enemy, Tim Tuttle.
Their work was particularly important on that
day, with the crew of the <i>Lucky Star</i> working so
near at hand; for the flags were to mark the
ownership of the mounds of "fat," and any tampering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
with these "brands" would be likely to
precipitate a violent encounter between the men
of the rival ships.</p>

<p>"I'm thinkin' 'twill snow afore night," Bill
panted, as they ran along; and, indeed, it appeared
that it would.</p>

<p>The advance soon had to be made with
caution. The hunters were so near the pack
that the whines of the white coats could be heard.
Archie could make out not only the harps, but
the blow-holes beside which they lay in family
groups. At this point the men formed in twos
and threes, and dispersed. In a few minutes
more, they rushed upon the prey, striking right
and left.</p>

<p>The ice was soon strewn with dead seals. It
was harvest time for these impoverished Newfoundlanders.
Lives of seals for lives of men and
women! Bill o' Burnt Bay had ten "kids" at
home, and he was merciless and mighty in destruction.</p>

<p>Archie and Billy came upon a family of four,
lying at some distance from their blow-hole&mdash;two
grown harps, a "jar," which is a one year
old seal, and a ranger, which is three years old
and spotted like a leopard. Billy attacked the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
ranger without hesitation. Archie raised his
gaff above the fluffy little jar, which was fanning
itself with its flipper, and whining.</p>

<p>"I can't do it!" he exclaimed, lowering his
club, and turning away, faint at heart; then
"Look, Billy!" he cried, in half amused wonderment.</p>

<p>The old seals had wriggled off to the blow-hole,
moving upon their flippers, in short jumps,
as fast as a man could walk. Apparently they
had reached the hole at the same instant, which
was not wide enough to admit them both.
Neither would give way to the other. They
were stuck fast, their heads below, their fat
bodies above.</p>

<p>Their selfish haste was their undoing. Billy was
not loath to take advantage of their predicament.</p>

<p>Thus, everywhere, the men were at work.
There was no friction with the crew of the <i>Lucky
Star;</i> the whole party worked amicably, and
almost side by side. When they had dispersed
the pack, the "sculping" knives were drawn,
and the labour of skinning was vigorously prosecuted.
The skins, with the blubber adhering,
were piled in heaps of six or more, according to
the strength of the men who were to "tow" them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
to the edge of the field, where the ship was to
return in the evening; and every "tow" was
marked with an Armstrong and Son flag.</p>

<p>The <i>Lucky Star's</i> recall gun surprised the men
before the work was finished. They looked up
to find that the dusk was upon them, and that
the snow was falling&mdash;falling ever more thickly,
and drifting with the wind. The men of the
<i>Lucky Star</i> stopped work, hurriedly saw to it
that their heaps of pelt were all marked, and
started on a run for the ship; for, on the ice
fields, the command of the recall gun is never
disregarded.</p>

<p>"There goes the <i>Dictator's</i> gun," shouted one
of the men.</p>

<p>A second boom added force to the warning.
The captain was evidently anxious to have his
men safe out of the storm; the "fat" could be
taken aboard in the morning. So Bill o' Burnt
Bay, who was in tacit command of the party,
called his men about him, and led the return.
It was a mile over the ice to the <i>Dictator</i>,
which lay waiting, with the second and third
parties aboard. He was in haste; moreover,
he had Sir Archibald Armstrong's son in his
care: perhaps, that is why he did not stop to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
count the <i>Dictator's</i> heaps of pelt before he
started.</p>

<p>"Come, now, Tuttle, don't lag!" he shouted,
ambitious to have his party return with no
delay.</p>

<p>But Tuttle still lagged&mdash;or, rather, ran from
heap to heap of pelt, as though to make sure
that each was marked. He busied himself, indeed,
until the party was well in advance&mdash;until,
as he thought, there was no eye to see what he
did under cover of the driving snow. Then he
quickly snatched <i>Lucky Star</i> flags from half a
dozen heaps of "fat," cast them away, and
planted <i>Dictator</i> flags in their stead&mdash;a dishonourable
duty which the house-flag of Armstrong
&amp; Son had never before been made to do.</p>

<p>Quite sure, now, that he had shot an arrow
that would sorely wound Captain Hand and the
firm of Armstrong &amp; Son, Tuttle ran after his
party. When he was yet some distance behind,
he turned about, and saw a small figure following
him. He stopped dead&mdash;and waited until
that small figure came up.</p>

<p>"Topsail," he demanded, "what you been
doin' back there?"</p>

<p>Billy was very much frightened; but he was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
truthful boy, and he now told the truth. "Been
sculpin' an' pilin' me swiles, sir," he stammered.</p>

<p>"Has you been touchin' them flags?"</p>

<p>"N-n-no, sir. I didn't have no time. I was
afeared I'd get lost in the snow."</p>

<p>Tuttle caught the boy by the shoulders, and
stared fiercely into his eyes. "Did you see
what I done?" he demanded.</p>

<p>Billy was strongly tempted to choose the
easier way; but, as I have said, he was a truthful
lad, and a brave lad, too. The temptation
passed in a moment, and he fearlessly returned
Tuttle's stare.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," he said.</p>

<p>"If you tells Cap'n Hand what you saw," said
Tuttle, tightening his grip, and bringing his face
close to the lad's, "I'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He did not complete the threat. Billy Topsail's
imagination, as he knew, would conceive
the most terrible revenge.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Billy gasped, vacantly; for he was
more frightened than he had ever before been in
his short life.</p>

<p>That was all. They ran at full speed after
their party, and soon joined it. Tuttle kept at
Billy's side while they were getting aboard the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
ship, kept at his side while supper was served in
the forecastle, kept at his side through the short
evening; kept at his side all the time, in a haunting,
threatening way that frightened Billy as
nothing else could, until the lad, tired out and
utterly discouraged as to the purpose he had
formed, turned in, no less to escape Tuttle, who
had now grown hateful to him, than to rest.</p>

<p>"Oh," he thought, "if Archie had on'y come
t' the fo'c's'le this night, I might 'a' told him;
but now&mdash;I thinks&mdash;I'll be afeared, in the
mornin'."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>

<div class='summary'><i>In Which Tim Tuttle's Shaft Flies Straight for
the Mark. The Crews of the Dictator and
Lucky Star Declare War, and Captain
Hand is Threatened with the Shame of Dishonour,
While Young Billy Topsail, Who Has
the Solution of the Difficulty, is in the Hold of
the Ship</i></div>


<div class='drop-cap'>TIM TUTTLE'S design against the honour
of Captain Hand and of the firm of
Armstrong &amp; Son promised well. The
following day broke fine; and, early in the morning,
the crew of the <i>Dictator</i> was turned out to
load the "fat" which had been left on the floe
over night. About one hundred men were sent
to the ice; the rest were kept on the ship to stow
away the "tows" as they came aboard. Among
the latter was young Billy Topsail, who was
ordered to the hold the moment he appeared on
deck.</div>

<p>The party under Bill o' Burnt Bay was first on
the ground. Presently, the men from the <i>Lucky
Star</i> arrived. For a time, pleasant words passed
between the crews. Soon, however, a group of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
<i>Lucky Star</i> hunters gathered out of hearing of
the <i>Dictator's</i> crew. Their voices, which had
been low at first, rose angrily, and to such a
pitch that the attention of Bill o' Burnt Bay was
attracted. He observed their suspicious glances,
their wrathful faces, their threatening gestures;
and he promptly surmised that trouble of a
familiar kind was brewing.</p>

<p>It was evident that there was to be a dispute
over the possession of certain of the "tows."
The rights of that dispute Bill was not in a position
to determine. So far as he knew&mdash;and he
was bound to stand squarely upon his own
knowledge&mdash;there had been no wrong-doing on
the part of his men; and, being a man who
never failed in his duty to the firm, he resolved
that not an ounce of "fat" which then lay under
a flag of Armstrong &amp; Son should be yielded to
the <i>Lucky Star</i> until a higher authority than he
gave the word. Needless to say, that is precisely
what Tuttle expected of him.</p>

<p>Moving quietly, lest he should provoke the
dispute, Bill warned his men to be on the alert.
And it was not long before the crew of the
<i>Lucky Star</i>, with a stout fellow at their head,
advanced threateningly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>"Look here, you, Bill o' Burnt Bay," shouted
the leader, "some o' your men have been stealin'
our tows."</p>

<p>"Oh, come, now, Johnny Tott," Bill replied,
good-humouredly, "that ain't our way o' gettin'
a cargo."</p>

<p>The men of the <i>Dictator</i> gathered behind Bill.
Bill would have been better pleased had they
gathered with less haste, had there been less of
the battle-light in their eyes, had they held their
gaffs less tightly&mdash;but all that, of course, was beyond
his control; he could only make sure to
have them there to defend the rights of the
firm.</p>

<p>"You can't scare <em>me!</em>" Johnny Tott flashed,
angered by what he understood to be a display
of force, but still trying to keep his temper.
"We left twenty-two tows here last night, an'
we find sixteen this mornin'. Who took the
odd six?"</p>

<p>Bill was bent on having the question referred
to the captains of the ships. <em>They</em> might settle
it as they would. As for him&mdash;knowing from
experience how quickly such encounters might
come, and how violent they might be&mdash;all he
desired was peaceably to protect the interests of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
his employers, and of the men, who had a percentage
interest in every seal killed.</p>

<p>"I don't want t' scare you, Johnny Tott," he
replied, quietly. "I thinks you've counted your
flags wrong. Now, why can't we just&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then came an unfortunate interruption. It was
a long, derisive cat-call from one of Bill's men&mdash;none
other than Tim Tuttle. That was more
than could be borne by men who were confident
of their rights.</p>

<p>"Thieves!" half a dozen of the crew of the
<i>Lucky Star</i> retorted. "A pack o' thieves!"</p>

<p>It was a critical moment. The <i>Dictator's</i> men,
too, believed themselves to be in the right; and
there was a limit to what they, too, could suffer.
To be called thieves was perilously near that
limit, already provoked, as they were, by what
they thought a bold attempt to rob them of
their seals.</p>

<p>Bill turned quickly on his own men. "Stand
back!" he cried, knowing well that a rush
impended.</p>

<p>"Thieves! Thieves!" taunted the crew of
the <i>Lucky Star</i>.</p>

<p>"Keep your men quiet!" Bill roared to
Johnny Tott. "There'll be trouble if you don't."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Lucky Star</i> men were outnumbered; but
not so far outnumbered that their case would be
hopeless in a hand-to-hand fight. Nevertheless,
it was the part of wisdom for Johnny Tott, who
was himself animated by the best motives, to
keep them quiet. He faced them, berated them
roundly, and threatened to "knock the first man
down" who should dare to continue the disturbance.
Thus encouraged, Bill o' Burnt Bay addressed
his crew briefly and to the point.</p>

<p>"No nonsense, men!" he growled. "We
wants no bloodshed here. The first man that
passes me," he added, in such a way that not a
man of them doubted he would make good his
word, "may get hurt, an' badly hurt, afore he
knows it."</p>

<p>It was no time for gentle dealing. Bill had
strong, angry men to deal with; and the responsibility
of keeping them from wronging
themselves and their fellows sat heavily upon
him. Confident, however, that he had them in
check, he advanced to parley with Tott. All
would doubtless have gone smoothly had there
not been a designing man on Bill's side. That
man was Tuttle, to whom the course of events
was not pleasing. Perceiving, now, that an encounter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
was likely to be warded off, he determined
to precipitate it.</p>

<p>"Who called me a thief?" he burst out.</p>

<p>Then he broke away from his fellows, and ran
towards the crew of the <i>Lucky Star</i>, with his gaff
upraised. But Bill o' Burnt Bay was quick as a
flash to intercept him. He tripped Tuttle up
with his gaff, fairly leaped upon the prostrate
form, caught the man by the collar, dragged him
back and flung him at the feet of the crew. And,
meantime, the <i>Lucky Star</i> men, who had instantly
prepared to meet Tuttle, laughed uproariously.
That hearty laugh lightened the situation perceptibly.</p>

<p>"An' here comes Cap'n Black!" shouted one
of the men.</p>

<p>Captain Hand of the <i>Dictator</i>, too, was on his
way over the ice. Both skippers had observed
the cessation of the work and the separation of
the men into two hostile parties. Familiar as
they were with such disputes, they needed no
message to tell them that their presence was urgently
needed on the floe. They came over the
ice at full speed, at the same time trying to get at
the merits of the quarrel from the men who ran to
meet them; and, being fat sea-captains, both of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
them, and altogether unused to hurried locomotion
afoot, they were quite out of breath when
they met.</p>

<p>The skipper of the <i>Lucky Star</i> was a florid,
peppery little man, much given to standing upon
his dignity.</p>

<p>"Cap'n Hand," he puffed, "this is&mdash;an out&mdash;rage,
sir! Is this the way&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Scuse me&mdash;Cap'n B-Black&mdash;sir," the skipper
of the <i>Dictator</i> panted, his little red eyes almost
hidden by his bushy brows; "but&mdash;I'm wonder&mdash;ful
s'prised&mdash;that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Captain Black drew a long breath, and proceeded
more easily, but still with magnificent
dignity. "<em>I'm</em> wonderful surprised t' know, sir,"
he said, "that <em>this</em> is the way Cap'n Hand makes
a good v'y'ge of it every year. I never knew
how before, sir."</p>

<p>"I'd have you t' know, sir," returned Captain
Hand, bristling ominously, "that I 'lows no man
t' call me a thief."</p>

<p>"I'd have you t' know, sir, that your men have
stolen my fat."</p>

<p>"An' I'll have you t' know, sir, that that's t' be
proved."</p>

<p>"Cap'n Hand, sir," declared Captain Black,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
swelling like a pouter-pigeon the meanwhile,
"you whole crew outnumbers mine nigh two t'
one, or I'd load every pound o' fat on the ice on
my ship. But I tells you now, sir, that I'll have
the law o' you at St. John's. If you touch
them six tows I'll have you sent t' coolie for a
thief, sir, if there's an honest jury in the land!
Mark my words, sir, I'll do it!"</p>

<p>The upshot of it all was, when both captains
had cut a ridiculous figure for a considerable time
(and had found it out), that the crews were withdrawn
to the ships, ostensibly for dinner, but
really that they might be kept apart while their
blood was heated. A conference was appointed
for three o'clock in the afternoon; and in the interval
the captains were more fully and more accurately
to inform themselves by examining their
respective crews. This was a very sensible
agreement. So far as it went, Captain Hand was
content; but, being a wise and experienced man,
he foresaw that an amicable settlement of the difficulty
was extremely doubtful.</p>

<p>"I hopes, anyhow, that 'twill not come t'
blows," he told Archie, as they trudged along, for
his position made it impossible for him to confide
in anybody else. "'Twill be a dreadful disgrace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
if it comes t' blows. An' maybe 'twill be something
worse."</p>

<p>When the men reached the <i>Dictator</i>, Billy Topsail
was waiting on deck, keen as the rest of them
to know what had happened on the ice. He had
a wholesome conscience, and a reasonable courage;
he had fully determined to do his duty, and
was about to attract Archie Armstrong's attention&mdash;Archie
was to be his first confidant&mdash;when
Tuttle slipped quietly to his side, and laid a hand
on his shoulder. Billy had no need to look up;
he knew whose hand that was, and what the firm,
increasing pressure meant.</p>

<p>"You better go t' the fo'c's'le, lad," Tuttle
whispered in his ear.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>

<div class='summary'><i>In Which the Issue is Determined</i></div>


<div class='drop-cap'>BILLY Topsail went to the forecastle as
he was bid. With Tuttle so near, he
seemed not to have the will to carry out
his purpose. He passed Archie on the way forward,
even responded to his nod and merry
greeting with a wistful smile; but said nothing,
for he felt that Tuttle's cold gray eyes were fixed
upon him. Archie marked that strange smile,
and thought&mdash;it was just a fleeting thought&mdash;that
Billy must be in trouble; he was about to stop,
but put the solicitous question off&mdash;until another
time.</div>

<p>Aboard the <i>Lucky Star</i>, Captain Black called
Johnny Tott to his cabin. It was a serious moment
for both, as both knew. The hunter
realized that the captain would act upon his
statement, and that there would be no return,
once the course was taken. Moreover, he knew
that he would have to take oath, and support
that oath with evidence, in the court-room at
St. John's.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, John, I wants just the plainest kind o'
truth," the captain began, for, shorn of his exaggerated
dignity, he was a fair, honest-hearted
man. "I've been friends with Cap'n Hand ever
since we was young, an' I've liked him every
hour o' that time, an' I've believed in him every
minute; so I'm in no humour t' have a fallin' out
with him. It'll go hard with the man who
wrongfully leads me into <em>that</em>. Come, now,
what's the <em>truth</em> o' all this?"</p>

<p>"The truth, sir," Johnny replied, slowly, "is
this: We left twenty-two tows on the ice last
night, every one with a Bryan &amp; Company flag
flyin' over it, an' we found but sixteen this
mornin'. That's all I knows about it."</p>

<p>"Did you make the count alone?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. They was three others, which,"
most importantly, "I can pro-dooce any minute."</p>

<p>"All right, Johnny," said the captain, striking
the table with his fist. "I believe you. You
won't find Cap'n Black go back on his crew.
I'll have that fat, if I have t' fight for it!"</p>

<p>While this was passing, Captain Hand had
summoned Bill o' Burnt Bay, Ebenezer Bowsprit
and two or three other trustworthy men to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
<em>his</em> cabin, and requested Archie Armstrong (the
good captain seemed to consider the lad in some
measure a representative of the firm) to hear the
interview. One and all, for themselves and for
the crew, they earnestly denied knowledge of
any trickery. They regretted, they said, that the
incident had occurred; but they believed that the
seals were the property of the ship, and they
hoped that the captain would not "see them
robbed."</p>

<p>"But, Bill," said the captain, hopelessly, "you
didn't <em>count</em> the tows?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," Bill answered, promptly, "I'm
bound t' say I didn't. After your two recall
guns, sir, we was in a hurry t' get aboard.
'Twas a fault, I knows, sir, but it can't be helped
now. I don't <em>know</em> that anybody changed the
flags. I hasn't any reason t' <em>think</em> so. So I
<em>believe</em> that the fat's ours."</p>

<p>"Well, men," the captain concluded, "that's
just my position. I <em>knows</em> nothin' t' the contrary;
so I got t' believe that the fat's ours.
You'll tell the crew that I'll stand by them.
We'll take that fat, whatever they tries t' do,
an' we'll let the courts decide afterwards. That's
all."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>There was fret and uncertainty for the captain
after the men trooped out. He was an honest
man, seeking the right, but not sure that he was
right. It seemed to him that, whatever the outcome,
his reputation and that of the firm would
be tarnished. In a trial at law, the crew of the
<i>Lucky Star</i> and the firm of Alexander Bryan &amp;
Company would appear as the aggrieved parties.
Men would say&mdash;yes, men would even publicly
take oath to it&mdash;that Captain Hand was a thief,
and that the firm of Armstrong &amp; Son abused its
power and wealth in sustaining him. Not everybody
would believe <em>that</em>, of course; but many
would&mdash;and the odium of the charge would
never disappear, let the verdict of the jury be
what it might.</p>

<p>"B'y," he said to Archie, in great distress,
"'tis a tryin' place t' be in. I wants t' wrong nobody.
'Twould wound me sore t' wrong Cap'n
Black, who's always been my friend. But I got
t' have that fat. A sealin' skipper that goes
back on his crew is not fit for command. I <em>must</em>
stand by the men. If I had an enemy, b'y," he
added, "an' that enemy wanted t' ruin me, he
couldn't choose a better&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Captain Hand stopped dead and stared at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
table&mdash;stared, and gaped, until his appearance
was altogether out of the common.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, cap'n?" asked Archie,
alarmed.</p>

<p>At that moment, however, there was a knock
at the door. Billy Topsail came in, pale and
wide-eyed; but the sight of Archie seemed to
compose him.</p>

<p>"I got t' tell you about Tim Tuttle," he began,
hurriedly. "I hears there's goin' t' be a fight,
an'&mdash;an'&mdash;I got t' tell you that I seed him
change the flags on the tows."</p>

<p>"What!" shouted the captain, jumping out of
his chair.</p>

<p>And so it all came out. At the end of the talk,
Billy Topsail was assured by the smiling captain
that he need not fear Tim Tuttle after a word or
two had been spoken with him. Bill o' Burnt
Bay was summoned, and corroborated Billy's
statement that Tuttle was the last man to leave
the tows. And Tuttle was the captain's enemy!
Everybody knew it. The difficulties were thus
all brushed away. The crew would accept the
explanation and be content. Tuttle would be
ridiculed until he was well punished for the trick
that had so nearly succeeded. It was a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
ending to the affair&mdash;a far better outcome than
any man aboard had dared hope for.</p>

<p>"Bill," said the captain, with an odd little
smile, "send Tim Tuttle t' Cap'n Black, with my
compliments; an' will Cap'n Black be so kind as
t' accept my apology, and have a friendly cup o'
tea with me immediate?"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Later, when Tuttle left the captain's cabin,
after the "word or two" had been spoken, he was
not grateful for the generous treatment he had received.
He meditated further mischief; but before
the second opportunity offered, there happened
something which put animosity out of the
hearts of all the crew.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>

<div class='summary'><i>It Appears That the Courage and Strength of the
Son of a Colonial Knight are to be Tried. The
Hunters are Caught in a Great Storm</i></div>


<div class='drop-cap'>THE <i>Lucky Star</i> and the <i>Dictator</i> parted
company the next day&mdash;the former bound
for the Labrador coast, the latter in a
southerly direction to White Bay. For several
days, the <i>Dictator</i> ran here and there among the
great floes, attacking small herds; and at the end
of a week she had ten thousand seals in her hold.
But that cargo did not by any means content
Captain Hand. Indeed, he began to fear the voyage
would be little better than a failure. Nothing
less than twenty thousands pelts would be a
profitable "haul" for a vessel of the <i>Dictator's</i>
tonnage to carry back to St. John's.</div>

<p>For that reason, perhaps, both the captain and
the men were willing to take some risk, when,
late one morning, a large herd was sighted on a
floe near the coast in the southwest. The danger
lay in the weather: it was an unpromising
day&mdash;cold and dull, and threatening snow and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
storm. For a time the captain hesitated; but, at
last, he determined to land his men in three
parties, caution them to be watchful and quick,
and himself try to keep the <i>Dictator</i> within easy
reach of them all. It really did not appear to be
necessary to waste the day merely because the
sky was dark over the coast.</p>

<p>Bill o' Burnt Bay's party was landed first.
Billy Topsail and Tim Tuttle were members of
it; and, as usual, Archie Armstrong attached
himself to it. As the <i>Dictator</i> steamed away to
land the second crew, and, thence, still further
away to land the third, Bill led his men on a trot
for the pack, which lay about a mile from the
water's edge.</p>

<p>"'Tis a queer day, this," Bill observed to the
boys, who trotted in his wake.</p>

<p>"Sure, why?" asked Billy.</p>

<p>"Is it t' snow, or is it not? Can you answer
me that? Sure, I most always can tell that little
thing, but t'-day I can't."</p>

<p>"'Tis like snow," Billy replied, puzzled, "an'
again 'tisn't. 'Tis queer, that!"</p>

<p>"I hopes the captain keeps the ship at hand,"
said Bill. "'Tis not t' my taste t' spend a night
on the floe in a storm."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>To be lost in a blizzard is a dreaded danger,
and not at all an uncommon experience. Many
crews, lost from the ship in a blinding storm,
have been carried out to sea with the floe, and
never heard of afterwards. Bill o' Burnt Bay lost
his own father in that way, and himself had had
two narrow escapes from the same fate. So he
scanned the sky anxiously, not only as he ran
along at the head of his sixty men, but from time
to time through the day, until the excitement of
the hunt put all else out of his head.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 380px;">
<img src="images/i010.jpg" width="380" height="348" alt="Bill calling to boys in storm" />
<div class="caption">"LASH YOUR TOWS, B'YS," SAID BILL. "LEAVE THE REST GO."</div>
</div>

<p>It was a profitable hunt. The men laboured
diligently and rapidly. So intent on the work
in hand were they that none observed the darkening
sky and the gusts of wind that broke from
behind the rocky coast. Thus, towards evening,
when the work was over save the sculping
and lashing, dusk caught them unaware. Bill
o' Burnt Bay looked up to find that the snow
was flying, that it was black as ink in the northeast,
and that the wind was blowing in long,
angry gusts.</p>

<p>"Men," he cried, "did you ever see a sky like
that?"</p>

<p>The men watched the heavy clouds in the
northeast rise and swiftly spread.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sure, it looks bad," muttered one.</p>

<p>"Make haste with the sculpin'," Bill ordered.
"They's wonderful heavy weather comin' up. I
mind me a time when a blizzard come out of a
sky like that."</p>

<p>The dusk grew deeper, the snow fell thicker,
the wind rose; and all this Bill observed while he
worked. Groups of men lashed their tows and
started off for the edge of the floe where the
steamer was to return for them.</p>

<p>"Lash your tows, b'ys," shouted Bill, to the
rest of the men. "Leave the rest go. 'Tis too
late t' sculp any more."</p>

<p>There was some complaint; but Bill silenced
the growlers with a sharp word or two. The
whole party set off in a straggling line, dragging
their tows; it was Bill who brought up the rear,
for he wanted to make sure that his company
would come entire to the landing-place. Strong,
stinging blasts of wind were then sweeping out of
the northeast, and the snow was fast narrowing
the view.</p>

<p>"Faster, b'ys!" cried Bill. "The storm's
comin' wonderful quick."</p>

<p>The storm came faster than, with all his experience,
Bill o' Burnt Bay had before believed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
possible. When he had given the order to
abandon the unskinned seals, he thought that
there was time and to spare; but, now, with less
than half the distance to the landing-place covered,
the men were already staggering, the wind
was blowing a gale, and the blinding snow almost
hid the flags at the water's edge. When
he realized this, and that the ship was not yet in
sight, "Drop everything, an' run for it!" was
the order he sent up the line.</p>

<p>"Archie, b'y," he then shouted, catching the
lad by the arm and drawing him nearer, "we
got t' run for the landing-place. Stick close t'
me. When you're done out, I'll carry you. Is
you afraid, b'y?"</p>

<p>Archie looked up, but did not deign to reply
to the humiliating question.</p>

<p>"All right, lad," said Bill, understanding.
"Is you ready?"</p>

<p>Archie knew that his strength and courage
were to be tried. He was tired, and cold, and
almost hopeless; but, then and there, he resolved
to prove his blood and breeding&mdash;to prove to
these men, who had been unfailingly kind to
him, but yet had naturally looked with good-natured
contempt upon his fine clothes and white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
hands, that fortitude was not incompatible with a
neat cravat and nice manners. Beyond all that,
however, it was his aim to prove that Sir Archibald
Armstrong's son was the son of his own
father.</p>

<p>"Lead on, Bill," he said.</p>

<p>"Good lad!" Bill muttered.</p>

<p>Archie bent to the blast.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII</h2>

<div class='summary'><i>In Which the Men are Lost, the Dictator is
Nipped and Captain Hand Sobs, "Poor Sir
Archibald!"</i></div>


<div class='drop-cap'>WHEN the last party of hunters had been
landed from the <i>Dictator</i>, the ship was
taken off the ice field; and there she
hung, in idleness, awaiting the end of the hunt.
It was then long past noon. The darkening sky
in the northeast promised storm and an early
night more surely than ever. It fretted the captain.
He was accountable to the women and
children of Green Bay for the lives of the men;
so he kept to the deck, with an eye on the
weather: and while the gloom deepened and
spread, a storm of anxiety gathered in his heart&mdash;and,
at last, broke in action.</div>

<p>"Call the watch, Mr. Ackell!" he cried, sharply.
"We'll wait no longer."</p>

<p>He ran to the bridge, signalled "Stand by!"
to the engine-room, and ordered the firing of the
recall gun. The men of the last party were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
within ear of the report. It brought all work on
the ice to a close. The men waited only to pile
the dead seals in heaps and mark possession
with flags.</p>

<p>"Again, mate!" shouted the captain.
"They're long about comin', it seems t' me."</p>

<p>A second discharge brought the men on a run
to the edge of the ice. It was evident that some
danger threatened. They ran at full speed,
crowded aboard the waiting boats, and were embarked
as quickly as might be. Then the ship
steamed off to the second field, five miles distant,
to pick up the second party. When she came
within hearing distance, three signal guns were
fired, with the result that, when she came to, the
men were waiting for the boats.</p>

<p>It was a run of six miles to the field upon which
the first party had been landed&mdash;part of the way
in and out among the pans. The storm had now
taken form and was advancing swiftly, and the
fields in the northeast were hidden in a spreading
darkness. The wind had risen to half a gale,
and it was beginning to snow. A run of six
miles! The captain's heart sank. When he
looked at the black clouds rising from behind the
coast, he doubted that the <i>Dictator</i> could do it in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
time. An appalling fortune seemed to be descending
on the men on the ice.</p>

<p>"But we may make it, mate," said the captain,
"if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ay, sir?"</p>

<p>"If they's no ice comin' with the gale."</p>

<p>The ship had been riding the open sea, skirting
the floe. Now she came to the mouth of a
broad lane, which wound through the fields. It
was the course; along that lane, at all hazards,
she must thread her way. The danger was extreme.
The wind, blowing a gale, might force
the great fields together. Or, if ice came with
the wind, the lanes might be choked up. In
either event, what chance would there be for the
men? In the first event, which was almost inevitable,
what chance would there be for the <i>Dictator</i>
herself?</p>

<p>"Cap'n Hand, sir," the mate began, nervously,
"is you goin'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The captain looked up in amazement when the
mate stammered and stopped. "Well, sir?" he
said.</p>

<p>"Is you goin' inside the ice, sir?"</p>

<p>"Is I goin' <span class="smcap">WHAT</span>?" roared the captain, turning
upon him. "Is I goin' <span class="smcap">WHAT</span>, sir?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>It was sufficient. The captain <em>was</em> going
among the fields. The mate needed no plainer
answer to his question.</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, sir," he muttered meekly. "I
thought you was."</p>

<p>"Huh!" growled the captain.</p>

<p>When the ship passed into the lane, the storm
burst overhead. The scunner in the foretop was
near blinded by the driven snow. His voice was
swept hither and thither by the wind. Directions
came to the bridge in broken sentences. The
captain dared not longer drive the vessel at full
speed.</p>

<p>"Half speed!" he signalled.</p>

<p>The ship crept along. For half an hour, while
the night drew on, not a word was spoken, save
the captain's quiet "Port!" and "Starboard!"
into the wheelhouse tube. Then the mate heard
the old man mutter:</p>

<p>"Poor b'y! Poor Sir Archibald!"</p>

<p>No other reference was made to the boy. In
the captain's mind, thereafter, for all the mate
knew, young Archibald Armstrong, the owner's
son, was merely one of a crew of sixty men, lost
on the floe.</p>

<p>"Ice ahead!" screamed the lookout in the bow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>The ship was brought to a stop. The lane she
had been following had closed before her. The
mate went forward.</p>

<p>"Heavy ice, sir," he reported.</p>

<p>Broken ice, then, had come down with the wind.
It had been carried into the channels, choking
them.</p>

<p>"Does you see water beyond, b'y?" the captain
shouted.</p>

<p>"'Tis too thick t' tell, sir."</p>

<p>The captain signalled "Go ahead!" The
chance must be taken. To be caught between
two fields in a great storm was a fearful situation.
So the ship pushed into the ice, moving at a
snail's pace, labouring hard, and complaining of
the pressure upon her ribs. Soon she made no
progress whatever. The screw was turning
noisily; the vessel throbbed with the labour of the
engines; but she was at a standstill.</p>

<p>"Stuck, sir!" exclaimed the mate.</p>

<p>"Ay, mate," the captain said, blankly,
"stuck."</p>

<p>The ship struggled bravely to force her way
on; but the ice, wedged all about her, was too
heavy.</p>

<p>"God help the men!" said the captain, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
signalled for the stopping of the engines. "We're
stuck!"</p>

<p>"An' God help us," the mate added, in the
same spirit, "if the fields come together!"</p>

<p>Conceive the situation of the <i>Dictator</i>. She
lay between two of many vast, shifting fields,
all of immeasurable mass. The captain had deliberately
subjected her to the chances in an
effort to rescue the men for whom he was accountable
to the women and children of Green
Bay. She was caught; and if the wind should
drive the fields together, her case would be desperate,
indeed. The slow, mighty pressure exerted
by such masses is irresistible. The ship
would either be crushed to splinters, or&mdash;a
slender chance&mdash;she would be lifted out of
danger for the time.</p>

<p>Had there been no broken ice about her, destruction
would have been inevitable. Her hope
now lay in that ice; for, with the narrowing of
the space in which it floated, it would in part be
forced deep into the water, and in part be
crowded out of it. If it should get under the
ship's bottom, it would exert an increasing upward
pressure; and that pressure might be strong
enough to lift the vessel clear of the fields. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
captain had known of such cases; but now he
smiled when he called them to mind.</p>

<p>"Take a week's rations an' four boats t' the
ice, mate," he directed, "an' be quick about it.
We'll sure have t' leave the ship."</p>

<p>While the mate went about this work, the
captain paced the bridge, regardless of the cold
and storm. It was dark, the wind was bitter and
strong, the snow was driving past; but still he
paced the bridge, now and then turning towards
the darkness of that place, far off on the floe,
where his men, and the young charge he had
been given, were lost. The women of Green Bay
would not forgive him for lives lost thus; of that
he was sure. And the lad&mdash;that tender lad&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Poor little b'y!" he thought. "Poor Sir
Archibald!"</p>

<p>For relief from this torturing thought, he went
among the men. He found most of them
gathered in groups, gravely discussing the situation
of the ship. In the forecastle, some were
holding a "prayer-meeting"; the skipper paused
to listen to the singing and to the solemn words
that followed it. Here and there, as he went
along, he spoke an encouraging word; here and
there dropped a word of advice, as, "Timothy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
b'y, you got too much on your back; 'tis not
wise t' load yourself down when you takes t' the
ice," and the like; here and there, in a smile or
a glance, he found the comforting assurance
that the men knew he had tried to do his
duty.</p>

<p>"Cap'n John Hand," he thought, when he returned
to the bridge, "you hasn't got a coward
aboard!"</p>

<p>The mate came up to report. "We've the
boats on the ice, sir," he said, "an' I've warned
the crew t' make ready."</p>

<p>"Very well, Mr. Ackell; they's nothin' more t'
be done."</p>

<p>"Hark, sir!"</p>

<p>The ice about the ship seemed to be stirring.
Beyond&mdash;from far off in the distance
to windward&mdash;the noise of grinding, breaking
ice-pans could be heard. There was no mistaking
the warning. The moment of peril was at
hand.</p>

<p>"The fields is comin' together, sir."</p>

<p>"Call the crew, Mr. Ackell," said the captain,
quietly.</p>

<p>The men gathered on deck. They were silent
while they waited. The only sounds came from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
the ice&mdash;and from overhead, where the wind was
screaming through the rigging.</p>

<p>"'Tis comin', sir," said the mate.</p>

<p>"Ay."</p>

<p>"God help us!"</p>

<p>"'Twill soon be over, Mr. Ackell," observed
the captain.</p>

<p>He awaited the event with a calm spirit.</p>

of Wind, and Archie Armstrong Finds Peril
and Hardship Stern Teachers. Concerning,

Tailor's Lay-Figure</i></div>


<div class='drop-cap'>BILL o' Burnt Bay did not lead a race for
the landing place. When he looked up, a
thick curtain of snow hid the flags. It
was then apparent to him that he and his men
must pass the night on the ice. In a blizzard
of such force and blinding density, no help
could reach them from the ship, even if she
managed to reach the place where the men were
to be taken aboard.</div>

<p>Nothing was visible but the space immediately
roundabout; and the wind had risen to such terrific
strength that sound could make small way
against it. Thus, neither lights nor signal guns
could be perceived&mdash;not though the ship should
beat her way to within one hundred yards of
where the group stood huddled. There was
nothing for it but to seek the shelter of an ice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
hummock, and there await the passing of the
storm.</p>

<p>"B'ys," he said to the few men who had gathered
about him, and he shouted at the top of his
voice, for the wind whisked low-spoken words
away, "they's a hummock somewheres handy.
Leave us get t' the lee of it."</p>

<p>"No, no!" several men exclaimed. "Leave
us get on t' the rest o' the crew. 'Tis no use stayin'
here."</p>

<p>"The path is lost, men," Bill cried. "You'll
lose your way&mdash;you'll lose your lives!"</p>

<p>But they would not listen. They hurried forward,
and were soon swallowed up by the night
and snow. Bill o' Burnt Bay was left alone with
Billy and Archie and a man named Osmond,
who was a dull, heavy fellow.</p>

<p>"They's a hummock within a hundred yards
o' here," Bill shouted. "I marked it afore the
snow got thick. We must find it. 'Tis&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Tis t' the left; 'tis over there," said Billy,
pointing to the left. "I marked it well."</p>

<p>"Ay 'tis somewheres t' the left. Our only
chance is t' find it. Now, listen well t' what I
says. We must spread out. I'll start off. Archie,
you follow me; keep sight o' me&mdash;keep just sight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
o' me, an' no more; but don't lose me, b'y, for
your life. Osmond, you'll follow the b'y; an' be
sure you watch him well. Billy, b'y, you'll follow
Osmond. When we gets in line, we'll face
t' the left an' go for'ard. The first t' see the
hummock will signal the next man, an' he'll pass
the word."</p>

<p>The three nodded their heads to signify their
understanding of these directions.</p>

<p>"Osmond, don't lose sight o' this b'y," said
Bill, impressively, placing his hand on Archie's
shoulder. "D'you mind? Men," he went on,
"if one loses sight o' the others, 'tis all up with
us. Leave your pelt go. I'll take mine."</p>

<p>Shelter from that frosty wind was imperative
in Archie's case. He made no complaint, for it
was not in his nature to complain; but, strong to
endure as he was, and stout as his spirit was, the
cold, striking through the fur and wool about
him, was having its inevitable effect.</p>

<p>When Bill moved off, dragging his burden of
pelt, the boy calmly waited until the stalwart
figure had been reduced to an outline; then,
with heavy steps, but fixed purpose to acquit
himself like a man, he followed, keeping his
distance. Osmond came next. Young Billy had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
the exposed position&mdash;a station of honour in
which he exulted&mdash;at the other end of the line.</p>

<p>Bill gave the signal, which was passed along
by Archie to Osmond and by him to Billy, and
they faced about and moved forward in the direction
in which the hummock lay.</p>

<p>Archie searched the gloom for the gray shape
of the hummock. It was a shelter&mdash;a mere relief.
But how despairingly he searched for a
sight of that formless heap of ice! Soon he began
to stumble painfully. Once he lost sight of
Bill o' Burnt Bay. Then he faltered, fell and
could not rise. It was the watchful Bill who
picked him up.</p>

<p>"What's this, b'y?" Bill asked, his voice
shaking.</p>

<p>"I fell down," Archie answered, sharply.
"That's all."</p>

<p>"I'll carry you, b'y," Bill began. "I'll carry
you, if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Archie roughly pushed the man away. Then
he stumbled forward, keeping his head up.</p>

<p>At that moment, Osmond, who was like a
shadow to the right, gave the signal. So Bill
knew that Billy, whom he could not see, had
chanced upon the hummock. He caught Archie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
up in his arms, against the boy's protests and
struggles, and ran with him to Osmond, and
thence to Billy, all the time dragging his "tow."</p>

<p>When they reached the lee of the ice, Archie
lay quietly in Bill's arms. He was about to fall
asleep, as Bill perceived.</p>

<p>"Unlash the tow," Bill said, quickly, to Osmond,
"an' start a fire."</p>

<p>With the help of Billy, Osmond took a pelt
from the pack, and spread it on the ice.</p>

<p>"They's no wood," he said, stupidly.</p>

<p>"Take the cross-bar o' the tow line, dunderhead!"
cried Billy. "Here! Leave me do it."</p>

<p>While Billy released the slender bar of wood
from the end of the line, stuck it in the blubber
and prepared to set fire to it, Bill was dealing
with Archie's drowsiness. He shook the lad
with all his strength, slapped him, shook him
again, ran him hither and thither, and, at last,
roused him to a sense of peril. The boy fought
desperately to restore his circulation.</p>

<p>"'Tis ready t' light," Billy said to Bill.</p>

<p>"Leave me do it," Bill answered. "Keep
movin', b'y," he cautioned Archie. "Don't you
give up."</p>

<p>Give up? Not he! And Archie said so&mdash;mumbled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
it scornfully to Bill, and repeated it
again and again to himself, until he was sick of
the monotony of the words, but could not stop
repeating them.</p>

<p>Neither Osmond nor Billy had matches, but
Bill had a box in his waistcoat pocket. He
shielded the contents from the wind and snow
while he took one match out. Then he closed
the box and handed it to Osmond to hold. It
was well that he did not return it to his own
pocket.</p>

<p>Archie was stumbling back and forth over the
twenty yards of sheltered space. He had a
great, shadowy realization of two duties: he
must keep in motion, and he must keep out of
the wind. All else had passed from his consciousness.
At every turn, however, he unwittingly
ventured further past the end of the
hummock.</p>

<p>Twice the wind, the full force of which he
could not resist, almost caught him. Then came
a time when he had to summon his whole
strength to tear himself from its clutch. He told
himself he must not again pass beyond the lee
of the ice. But, before he returned to that point,
he had forgotten the danger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>A mighty gust laid hold on him, carried him
off his feet, and swept him far out into the darkness.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
It chanced that Billy Topsail, who had
kept an eye on Archie, caught sight of him as
he fell.</p>

<p>"Archie!" the boy screamed.</p>

<p>"Archie?" cried Bill, looking up. "What&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Archie had even then been carried out of sight.
Billy leaped to his feet and followed. He gave
himself to the same gust of wind, and, with
difficulty keeping himself upright, was carried
along with it. Bill grasped the situation in a
flash. He, too, leaped up, and ran into the
storm.</p>

<p>"Archie, b'y!" he cried. "Where is you?
Oh, where is you, lad?" It was the first time in
many years that heart's agony had wrung a cry
from old Bill o' Burnt Bay.</p>

<p>Billy Topsail was carried swiftly along by the
wind. It was clear to him that, should he diverge
from the path of the gust, not only would
he be unable to find the lost boy, but he himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
would be in hopeless case. The wind swept him
close upon Archie's track, but, as its force wasted,
ever more slowly. He soon tripped over an obstruction,
and plunged forward on his face. He
recovered, and crawled back. There he came
upon Archie, lying in a heap, half covered by a
drift of snow.</p>

<p>"B'y," Billy shouted, "is you dead?"</p>

<p>Archie opened his eyes. Billy Topsail looked
close, but could see no light of intelligence in
them. He shook the boy violently.</p>

<p>"Wake up!" he cried. "Wake up!"</p>

<p>"What?" Archie responded, faintly.</p>

<p>Billy lifted him to his feet, but there was no
strength in the lad's legs; he was limp as a
drunken man. But this exertion restored Billy
Topsail; he felt his own strength returning&mdash;a
strength which the arduous toil of the coast had
mightily developed.</p>

<p>"Stand up, b'y!" he shouted in Archie's ear.
"Put your arm on my shoulder. I'll help you
along."</p>

<p>"No," Archie muttered. But despite this protest
he was lifted up; then he said: "Give me
your hand. I'm all right."</p>

<p>Billy wasted no words. He locked his arms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
about Archie's middle, lifted him, and staggered
forward against the wind.</p>

<p>The wind had fallen somewhat, and he made
some progress. But the burden was heavy, and
twice he fell. Then he heard Bill o' Burnt Bay's
voice, and he shouted a response, but the wind
carried the words away. He could hear Bill,
who was to windward, but Bill could not hear
him. So when the call came again, he marked
the location and staggered in that direction.</p>

<p>"Oh, Billy! Oh, Archie!"</p>

<p>The voice was nearer&mdash;and to the left. Billy
Topsail changed his course. The next cry came
from the right again. Was the wind deceiving
him? Or was Bill changing his place? Then
came a ringing cry near at hand.</p>

<p>"Bill!" screamed Billy Topsail.</p>

<p>"Here! Where is you?"</p>

<p>Bill's great body emerged from the darkness.
He cried out joyfully as he rushed forward, took
Archie from Billy's arms, and slung him over his
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Praise God!" he muttered tremulously, when
he felt life stirring in the small body.</p>

<p>He put his face close to Billy Topsail's and
looked steadily into the boy's eyes for an instant;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
and no words were needed to say what he
meant.</p>

<div class="caption">"WE'RE SAVED!" SAID BILL.</div>
</div>

<p>But where was the hummock? Bill looked
about.</p>

<p>"'Tis there," said Billy, pointing ahead.</p>

<p>Bill shook his head. His homing instinct, to
which he had trusted his life in many a fog and
night, told him otherwise. Reason entered into
his decision not at all; he merely waited until he
was persuaded that his face was turned in the
right direction. Then he started off unhesitatingly.
He had found the harbour entrance thus
in many a thick summer night when his fishing
punt rode a trackless sea.</p>

<p>"Take hold o' me jacket, b'y," he said to Billy.
"Mind you stick close by me."</p>

<p>For some time they wandered without seeing
any sign of the hummock. Bill's heart sank lower
and lower; for he knew that if they did not soon
find shelter, Archie would die in his arms. At last
Bill caught sight of a light&mdash;a dull, glowing light.</p>

<p>"Is that a fire?" he asked.</p>

<p>"'Tis the hummock!" Billy cried. "'Tis Osmond
with the fire goin'. 'Tis he! 'Tis he!"</p>

<p>"We're saved," said Bill.</p>

<p>Once in the lee of the hummock, they roused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
Archie from his stupor, and warmed him over the
fire, which Osmond, after many failures, had succeeded
in lighting. They broke the cross-piece
of the tow line in two, took another pelt from the
pack, and made two fires. The wood was like
the wick in a candle; it blazed in the blubber,
and was not consumed. Between the fires they
huddled together, with Archie in the middle.
Their bodies warmed the lad, and he slumbered
snugly, quietly, through the night. Billy Topsail,
more sturdy of body, if not of spirit, kept
awake, and had a part in the talk with which
each tried to cheer the others through the fearful,
dragging hours.</p>

<p>"'Tis the day," said Bill, at last, pointing to the
east.</p>

<p>The wind abated as the dawn advanced, and
the snow ceased to fall. Light crept over the
field, and men appeared from behind clumpers of
ice. Group signalled to group. All made their
way to the place where the ship had landed them,
a dozen men were already clustered&mdash;a gaunt,
haggard, frost-bitten crowd. The terrors of the
night still oppressed them, and, through weeks,
would haunt their dreams.</p>

<p>They counted their number. Fifty-nine living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
men were there; and there was one dead body&mdash;that
of Tim Tuttle of Raggles Island, who had
strayed away from his fellows and been lost.
And thus they awaited the full break of day, while
eyes were strained into the departing night.
Where was the ship? Had she survived?
These were the questions they asked one another.</p>

<p>"What's that patch o' black?" Bill o' Burnt
Bay asked. "Due west, lads&mdash;a mile or more
off?"</p>

<p>"Sure, it looks like the ship," some of the men
agreed.</p>

<p>As the light increased, the storm passed on.
A burst of sunshine at last revealed the <i>Dictator</i>,
lying on the ice, listed far to port. The broken ice
in which she had been caught, they learned afterwards,
had been forced under her, and she had
been lifted out of danger when the fields that
nipped her came together.</p>

<p>When it is said that old Captain Hand welcomed
his crew with open arms, and embraced
Archie&mdash;the meanwhile searching through all
his pockets for a handkerchief, which he could
not find&mdash;there remains little to be told. He
was more haggard than the rescued men. What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
depths his brave spirit sounded on that long
night are not to be described.</p>

<p>"Well, b'y," was what he said to Archie,
"you're back, is you?"</p>

<p>"Safe and sound, cap'n," the boy replied,
wearily, "and hungry."</p>

<p>"Send the cook for'ard with the scoff!"
roared the captain.</p>

<p>Before noon, all the men were safe aboard,
and the ice was breaking up. When the
<i>Dictator</i> settled softly into the water, at the
parting of the fields, the pelt was stowed away.
She had no difficulty in making the open sea;
and thence she set forth in search of other floes
and other seal packs.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <i>Dictator</i> made Long Tom Harbour without
mishap. There it was made known that the name
of Billy Topsail of Ruddy Cove was "on the
books," and not a man grumbled because the
lad was to share with the rest. There, too, old
John Roth, to whom two "white coats" had
been promised, claimed the gift of Archie, and
was not disappointed. And there Archie said
good-bye to Billy for the time.</p>

<p>"I'll see you this summer," he said. "Don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
forget, Billy. I'll spend a week of vacation time
with you at Ruddy Cove."</p>

<p>"No," Billy replied. "You'll spend it at New
Bay. Sure, me name is on the books, an' I'm
goin' after lobsters with me own skiff in July."</p>

<p>"I'll go with you, if you'll take me," said
Archie. "And I can never, never forget that
you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sure," Billy Topsail interrupted, flushing,
"you'll go with me t' New Bay. An' times we'll
have of it!"</p>

<p>"Good-bye!"</p>

<p>"Good-bye, b'y!"</p>

<p>And so they parted on terms of perfect
equality.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That summer, Billy Topsail went to New Bay.
But it was not in a skiff; it was in a swift little
sloop, especially made to be sailed by a crew
of one. It came North, mysteriously, from
St. John's, to the wonder of all Green Bay; and
its name was <i>Rescue</i>. And a letter came North
for Bill o' Burnt Bay: which, when he read it,
stirred him to the profoundest depth of his
rugged old heart, for he roared in a most unmannerly
fashion that he'd "be busted if he'd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
take a thing for standin' by such a lad!" In
reply to a second letter, however, Bill said he
would "be willin' t' take it on credit, if he'd be
'lowed t' pay for it as he could." So that is how
Bill o' Burnt Bay came to sail to the Labrador
in his own fore-and-after, when the fish were
running.</p>

<p>And, once, Sir Archibald Armstrong turned
to his son. "Well, my boy," he said, slowly,
"I've been wanting to ask you a question.
What do you think of your shipmates?"</p>

<p>"I think they're heroes, every one!" Archie
answered.</p>

<p>"Do you think you now know the difference
between a man and a tailor's lay-figure?"</p>

<p>"Oh, sir," Archie laughed, "I'll never forget
<em>that!</em>"</p>

<p>Billy Topsail had never needed to learn.</p>
